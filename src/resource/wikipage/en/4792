'''Barry Morris Goldwater''' (January 2, 1909<ref>Internet Accuracy Project, [http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Goldwater,Barry.html Senator Barry Goldwater]. Retrieved September 23, 2010.</ref> – May 29, 1998) was an American politician and businessman who was a five-term [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Arizona]] (1953–65, 1969–87) and the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]'s nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 election]]. Goldwater is the politician most often credited for sparking the resurgence of the [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] political movement in the 1960s. He also had a substantial impact on the [[libertarianism|libertarian movement]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Robert | last = Poole | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_n4_v30/ai_20954419 | title = In memoriam: Barry Goldwater | type = Obituary | newspaper = [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |date=August–September 1998| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120322061559/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_n4_v30/ai_20954419/ | archivedate = March 22, 2012 }}</ref>

Goldwater rejected the legacy of the [[New Deal]] and fought through the [[conservative coalition]] against the [[New Deal coalition]]. He mobilized a large [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] constituency to win the hard-fought Republican primaries. He was the first candidate of [[American Jews|Jewish]] heritage to be nominated for President by a major American party.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Harold|last2=Buckland|first2=Gail|last3=Baker|first3=Kevin|date=1998|title=The American Century|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=a013AAAAMAAJ&q=%22The+first+major+candidate+known+to+be+of+ethnic+Jewish+origin,+Goldwater+used+to+Joke+that+only+half+of+him+could+join+an+exclusive+country+club.%22&dq=%22The+first+major+candidate+known+to+be+of+ethnic+Jewish+origin,+Goldwater+used+to+Joke+that+only+half+of+him+could+join+an+exclusive+country+club.%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiu8_W8gPXKAhXDJR4KHeNlC6wQ6AEIEzAA|location=|publisher=Knopf|page=515|ISBN=0679410708|quote=The first major candidate known to be of ethnic Jewish origin, Goldwater used to Joke that only half of him could join an exclusive country club.}}</ref><ref>http://www.dailywire.com/news/3345/no-it-doesnt-matter-bernie-sanders-ethnically-ben-shapiro</ref><ref>http://www.salon.com/2016/02/11/why_bernie_sanders_judaism_is_so_important/</ref> Goldwater's conservative campaign platform ultimately failed to gain the support of the electorate{{Sfn | White | 1965 | p = 217}} and he lost the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] to incumbent [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] by one of the largest landslides in history, bringing down many Republican candidates as well. The Johnson campaign and other critics painted him as a [[reactionary]], while supporters praised his crusades against the [[Soviet Union]], [[labor union]]s, and the [[welfare state]]. His defeat allowed Johnson and the Democrats in Congress to pass the [[Great Society]] programs, but the defeat of so many older Republicans in 1964 also cleared the way for a younger generation of American conservatives to mobilize. Goldwater was much less active as a national leader of conservatives after 1964; his supporters mostly rallied behind [[Ronald Reagan]], who became governor of [[California]] in 1967 and the 40th [[President of the United States]] in 1981.

Goldwater returned to the Senate in 1969, and specialized in defense policy, bringing to the table his experience as a senior officer in the [[Air Force Reserve]]. In 1974, as an elder statesman of the party, Goldwater successfully urged President [[Richard Nixon]] to resign when evidence of a cover-up in the [[Watergate scandal]] became overwhelming and impeachment was imminent. By the 1980s, the increasing influence of the [[Christian right]] on the [[Factions in the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] so conflicted with Goldwater's views that he became a vocal opponent of the religious right on issues such as [[abortion]], [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]], and the role of religion in public life. After narrowly winning re-election to the Senate in 1980, he chose not to run for a sixth term in 1986, and [[United States Senate election in Arizona, 1986|was succeeded]] by fellow Republican [[John McCain]]. A significant accomplishment in his career was the passage of the [[Goldwater–Nichols Act]] of 1986, which restructured the higher levels of the [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]] by placing the chain of command from the [[President of the United States of America|President]] to the [[Secretary of Defense]] directly to the commanders of the [[Unified Combatant Command]]s.

{{Libertarianism sidebar}}
Goldwater was born in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], in what was then the [[Arizona Territory]], the son of Baron M. Goldwater and his wife, Hattie Josephine ("JoJo") Williams. His father's family had founded [[Goldwater's]], the largest [[department store]] in Phoenix.{{cn|date=February 2016}} Goldwater's paternal grandfather, Michel Goldwasser, a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jew]], was born in 1821 in Poland, from which he emigrated to London following the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. Soon after arriving in London, he anglicized his name from "Goldwasser" to "Goldwater". Michel married Sarah Nathan, a member of a [[History of the Jews in England|Jewish English]] family, in the [[Great Synagogue of London]].<ref>{{cite web| first = George | last = Zornik | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1284836.html | title =Thoroughly modern grandmothers |publisher=High beam | accessdate=March 3, 2012| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430215538/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1284836.html | archivedate=April 30, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/barrygoldwater.htm | work=The Washington Post | date=May 13, 1997 | accessdate=March 30, 2010 | title= Barry Goldwater}}</ref>

Goldwater's mother, who was [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], came from a [[New England]] family that included the theologian, [[Roger Williams]] of [[Rhode Island]].{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | pp = 21}}  Goldwater's parents were married in an Episcopal church in Phoenix; for his entire life, Goldwater was an Episcopalian, though on rare occasions he referred to himself as "[[Jewish]]".<ref name=NYTObit>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/04/01/specials/goldwater-obit.html | work=The New York Times |author=ADAM CLYMER|date=May 29, 1998| archivedate=March 7, 2013 | title=Barry Goldwater, Conservative and Individualist, Dies at 89| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307223049/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/04/01/specials/goldwater-obit.html |deadurl=no}}</ref> While he did not often attend church, he stated that "If a man acts in a religious way, an ethical way, then he's really a religious man—and it doesn't have a lot to do with how often he gets inside a church".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876116,00.html |title=Worship: Goldwater's Faith | work =Time|date=August 28, 1964 |accessdate=March 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823153750/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876116,00.html|archivedate=August 23, 2013}}</ref>{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | pp = 22–27, esp. 27}}<ref>A Jewish essayist famously remarked of Goldwater: {{Citation | last = Golden | first = Harry Golden | quote = I have always thought that if a Jew ever became President, he would turn out to be an Episcopalian. | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898063,00.html | title = The Taboo | newspaper = Time | date = November 22, 1963| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130817071659/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898063,00.html | archivedate = August 17, 2013 }}</ref>

The family department store made the Goldwaters comfortably wealthy. Goldwater graduated from [[Staunton Military Academy]], an elite private school in Virginia, and attended the [[University of Arizona]]<ref name=NYTObit /><ref>{{Biographical Directory of Congress|G000267|inline=yes}}</ref> for one year, where he joined the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity. Barry had never been close to his father, but he took over the family business after Baron's death in 1930. He became a Republican (in a heavily Democratic state), promoted innovative business practices, and opposed the [[New Deal]], especially because it fostered labor unions. Goldwater came to know former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]], whose conservative politics he admired greatly.

===Family===
In 1934, he married Margaret "Peggy" Johnson, wealthy daughter of a prominent industrialist from [[Muncie, Indiana]]. They had four children: Joanne (born January 1, 1936), [[Barry Goldwater Jr.|Barry]] (born July 15, 1938), Michael (born March 15, 1940), and Peggy (born July 27, 1944). Goldwater became a widower in 1985, and in 1992 he married Susan Wechsler, a nurse 32 years his junior.{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | pp. 41–42, 48–49, 326, 332}}

Goldwater's son [[Barry Goldwater Jr.]] served as a [[United States House of Representatives]] member from [[California]] from 1969 to 1983.

Goldwater's grandson, Ty Ross, a former Zoli model, is openly gay and HIV positive, and the one who inspired the elder Goldwater "to become an octogenarian proponent of gay civil rights."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rich|first1=Frank|title=Journal; The Right Stuff|journal=The New York Times|year=1998|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/03/opinion/journal-the-right-stuff.html}}</ref>

===Military career===
With the American entry into [[World War II]], Goldwater received a reserve commission in the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. He became a pilot assigned to the Ferry Command, a newly formed unit that flew aircraft and supplies to war zones worldwide. He spent most of the war flying between the U.S. and [[India]], via the [[Azores]] and North Africa or [[South America]], [[Nigeria]], and Central Africa. He also flew "the hump" over the [[Himalayas]] to deliver supplies to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].

Following World War II, Goldwater was a leading proponent of creating the [[United States Air Force Academy]], and later served on the Academy's Board of Visitors. The visitor center at the USAF Academy is now named in his honor. As a colonel he also founded the [[Arizona Air National Guard]], and he would [[desegregate]] it two years before the rest of the US military. Goldwater was instrumental in pushing the Pentagon to support desegregation of the armed services.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-EgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=goldwater+and+the+desegregation+of+the+arizona+air+national+guard&source=bl&ots=ZpoJA8bHRB&sig=JI8LrknD0ER1FQqg-Q7HQZim7hM&ei=2sYsTci4JIG8lQeP1sywCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=goldwater%20and%20the%20desegregation%20of%20the%20arizona%20air%20national%20guard&f=false | contribution =Life | publisher = Google | title = Books |date=September 18, 1964 |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}</ref>

Remaining in the Arizona [[Air National Guard]] and [[Air Force Reserve]] after the war, he eventually retired as a [[Command Pilot]] with the rank of [[Major general (United States)|major general]].<ref>{{cite web| publisher=US Air Force |title=Major General Barry M Goldwater |url=http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=5574|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802124105/http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=5574|archivedate=August 2, 2013}}</ref> By that time, he had flown 165 different types of aircraft. Goldwater retired as an Air Force Reserve major general, and he continued piloting B-52 aircraft until late in his military career. To those who called him "rash", he would remind people of the old saying that "there are no old, bold pilots".

===Interests===
Goldwater ran track and cross country in high school, where he specialized in the 880&nbsp;yard run. His parents strongly encouraged him to compete in these sports, to Goldwater's dismay. He often went by the nickname of "Rolling Thunder."

In 1940, Goldwater became one of the first people to run the [[Colorado River]] recreationally through [[Grand Canyon]] participating as an oarsman on [[Norman Nevills]]' second commercial river trip. Goldwater joined them in [[Green River, UT|Green River, Utah]] and rowed his own boat down to [[Lake Mead]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Lavender | first = David | title = River Runners of the Grand Canyon | ISBN = 978-0-8165-0940-9}}</ref>

In 1970, the Arizona Historical Foundation published the daily journal Goldwater had maintained on the Grand Canyon journey, including his photographs, in a 209-page volume titled ''Delightful Journey''.

In 1963, he joined the Arizona Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]]. He was also a lifetime member of the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], the [[American Legion]], and [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity. He belonged to both the [[York Rite]] and [[Scottish Rite]] of Freemasonry, and was awarded the 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite.

==Political career==
In a heavily Democratic state, Goldwater became a conservative Republican and a friend of [[Herbert Hoover]]. He was outspoken against [[Modern liberalism in the United States|New Deal liberalism]], especially its close ties to labor unions he considered corrupt. A pilot, outdoorsman and photographer, he criss-crossed Arizona and developed a deep interest in both the natural and the human history of the state. 

He entered Phoenix politics in 1949, when he was elected to the City Council as part of a nonpartisan team of candidates pledged to clean up widespread prostitution and gambling. The team won every mayoral and council election for the next two decades. Goldwater rebuilt the weak Republican party and was instrumental in electing [[John Howard Pyle|Howard Pyle]] as [[Governor of Arizona|Governor]] in 1950.<ref>Robert Alan Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' (1995) pp. 67–98</ref><ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwaterchrono.htm | work= The Washington Post | date=June 5, 1998 | accessdate=March 30, 2010 | title=A Look at the Life of Barry Goldwater| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111132733/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwaterchrono.htm | archivedate=November 11, 2012 }}</ref>

=== US Senator ===
As a Republican he won a seat in the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] in [[United States Senate election in Arizona, 1952|1952]], when he upset veteran Democrat and Senate Majority Leader [[Ernest McFarland]]. He defeated McFarland again in [[United States Senate elections, 1958|1958]], with a strong showing in his first reelection in a year the Democrats gained 13 seats in the Senate. He gave up re-election for the Senate in 1964 in favor of his presidential campaign.

During his Senate career, Goldwater was regarded as the "Grand Old Man of the Republican Party and one of the nation's most respected exponents of conservatism."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Bart|title=Barry Goldwater, GOP Hero, Dies|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater30.htm|accessdate=October 4, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=May 30, 1998}}</ref>

=== Republican presidential Primary, 1964 ===
In 1964, Goldwater fought and won a bitterly contested, multi-candidate race for the Republican Party's presidential nomination. His main rival was New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], whom he defeated by a narrow margin in the bitterly fought California primary. His nomination was opposed by liberal Republicans, who thought Goldwater's demand for [[rollback]], defeat of the [[Soviet Union]], would foment a nuclear war.

In South Dakota and Florida, Goldwater finished second to "unpledged delegates", but he finished before all other candidates.
]]
At the time of Goldwater's presidential candidacy, the Republican Party was split between its conservative wing (based in the West and South) and moderate/liberal wing, sometimes called [[Rockefeller Republican]]s (based in the Northeast). He alarmed even some of his fellow partisans with his brand of staunch [[Fiscal conservatives|fiscal conservatism]] and militant [[anti-communism]]. He was viewed by many traditional Republicans as being too far on the [[right wing]] of the political spectrum to appeal to the mainstream majority necessary to win a national election. As a result, moderate Republicans recruited a series of opponents, including [[New York]] Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Pennsylvania]] Governor [[William Scranton]], to challenge Goldwater. Goldwater would defeat Rockefeller in the winner-take-all California primary and secure the nomination. He also had a solid backing from Southern Republicans. A young  [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] lawyer, [[John Grenier]], secured commitments from 271 of 279 southern convention delegates to back Goldwater. Grenier would serve as executive director of the national GOP during the Goldwater campaign, the number 2 position to party chairman [[Dean Burch]] of Arizona.

Goldwater famously declared in his bold acceptance speech at the 1964 Republican Convention, "I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue." This paraphrase of [[Cicero]] was included at the suggestion of [[Harry V. Jaffa]], though the speech was primarily written by [[Karl Hess]]. Because of President Johnson's popularity, however, Goldwater refrained from attacking the president directly. He did not mention Johnson by name at all in his convention speech.

[[File:Goldwater-Reagan in 1964.jpg|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan]] speaks for presidential candidate Goldwater in Los Angeles in 1964]]
Former U.S. Senator [[Prescott Bush]], a [[moderate Republican]] from [[Connecticut]], was a friend of Goldwater and supported him in the general election campaign. Bush's son, [[George H. W. Bush]] (then running for the Senate from Texas against Democrat [[Ralph Yarborough]]), was also a strong Goldwater supporter in both the nomination and general election campaigns.

Future Chief Justice of the United States and fellow Arizonan [[William H. Rehnquist]] also first came to the attention of national Republicans through his work as a legal adviser to Goldwater's presidential campaign. Rehnquist had begun his law practice in 1953 in the firm of [[Denison Kitchel]] of Phoenix, Goldwater's national campaign manager and friend of nearly three decades.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/24/local/me-kitchel24|title=Denison Kitchel, 94; Ran Goldwater's Presidential Bid|date=October 24, 2002|first=Dennis|last=McLellan|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=June 2, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106065221/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/24/local/me-kitchel24|archivedate=November 6, 2013}}</ref>

Goldwater was painted as a dangerous figure by the Johnson campaign, which countered Goldwater's slogan "In your heart, you know he's right" with the lines "In your guts, you know he's nuts", and "In your heart, you know he might" (that is, he might actually use nuclear weapons as opposed to using only [[deterrence theory|deterrence]]). Johnson himself did not mention Goldwater in his own acceptance speech at the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]].

Goldwater's provocative advocacy of aggressive tactics to prevent the spread of communism in Asia led to effective counterattacks from [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and his supporters, who claimed that Goldwater's militancy would have dire consequences, possibly even nuclear war. In a May 1964 speech, Goldwater suggested that nuclear weapons should be treated more like conventional weapons and used in Vietnam, specifically that they should have been used at [[Dien Bien Phu]] in 1954 to defoliate trees.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nuclear Weapons and the Vietnam War|url=http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pub/vietnam_weapons.pdf|last=Tannenwald |first=Nina|journal=The Journal of Strategic Studies|volume=29|issue=4|year=2006|pages=675–722|doi=10.1080/01402390600766148|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6LOJRPaoH|archivedate=November 25, 2013}}</ref> Regarding Vietnam, Goldwater charged that Johnson's policy was devoid of "goal, course, or purpose", leaving "only sudden death in the jungles and the slow strangulation of freedom".<ref>Matthews 2002</ref> Goldwater's rhetoric on nuclear war was viewed by many as quite uncompromising, a view buttressed by off-hand comments such as, "Let's lob one into the men's room at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]]."<ref>{{cite web |work=Harper's Magazine |url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2004/Republican-Propaganda1sep04.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817160822/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2004/Republican-Propaganda1sep04.htm|archivedate=August 17, 2010}}</ref> He also advocated that field commanders in Vietnam and Europe should be given the authority to use [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s (which he called "small conventional nuclear weapons") without presidential confirmation.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11-IA1&dq=goldwater+1964+%22small+conventional+nuclear+weapons%22)+intitle:life&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TQxPT4KGFMmngwftxsXoDQ&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA |title=Our Defense: a Crucial Issue for Candidates |work=Life |date=September 25, 1964 |page=11 |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}</ref>

Goldwater did his best to counter the Johnson attacks, criticizing the Johnson administration for its perceived ethical lapses, and stating in a commercial that "we, as a nation, are not far from the kind of moral decay that has brought on the fall of other nations and people.... I say it is time to put conscience back in government. And by good example, put it back in all walks of American life."

Before the 1964 election, the muckraking ''[[Fact (U.S. magazine)|Fact]]'' magazine, published by [[Ralph Ginzburg]], ran a special issue titled "The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater". The two main articles contended that Goldwater was mentally unfit to be president. The magazine attempted to support this claim with the results of an unscientific poll of psychiatrists it had conducted. ''Fact'' had mailed questionnaires to 12,356 psychiatrists, and published a "sampling" of the comments made by the 2,417 psychiatrists who responded, of whom 1,189 said Goldwater was unfit to be president. Not one of the psychiatrists had actually interviewed Goldwater himself.<ref>{{cite news |author=[[Richard A.

After the election, Goldwater sued the publisher, the editor and the magazine for libel in ''[[Goldwater v. Ginzburg]]''.

=====Political advertising=====
{{Main|Daisy (advertisement)}}
A Democratic campaign advertisement known as [[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]] showed a young girl counting daisy petals, from one to ten. Immediately following this scene, a voiceover counted down from ten to one. The child's face was shown as a still photograph followed by images of [[Effects of nuclear explosions|nuclear explosions]] and [[mushroom cloud]]s. The campaign advertisement ended with a plea to vote for Johnson, implying that Goldwater (though not mentioned by name) would provoke a [[nuclear war]] if he was elected. The advertisement, which featured only a few spoken words and relied on imagery for its emotional impact, was one of the most provocative in American political campaign history, and many analysts credit it as being the birth of the modern style of "[[negative campaigning|negative political ads]]" on television. The ad aired only once and was immediately pulled, but it was then shown many times by local television stations.<ref>{{cite web

Past comments came back to haunt Goldwater throughout the campaign. He had once called the [[Dwight D.

Conservative activist [[Phyllis Schlafly]], later well known for her fight against the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], first became known for writing a pro-Goldwater book, ''A Choice, Not an Echo'', attacking the moderate Republican establishment.

=====Results=====
[[File:ElectoralCollege1964.svg|thumb|right|300px|Presidential election results by state.]]
Goldwater [[United States presidential election, 1964|lost to President Lyndon Johnson]] by a massive landslide, pulling down the GOP, which lost many seats in both houses of Congress.

Goldwater only won his home state of Arizona and five states in the [[Deep South]], depicted in red. The Southern states, traditionally Democratic up to that time, voted Republican primarily as a statement of opposition to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]], which had been passed by Johnson and the Northern Democrats, as well as the majority of Republicans in Congress, earlier that year.<ref name="Bernard Cosman 1966" /><ref>Charles S Bullock III, and Mark J. Rozell, ''The Oxford Handbook of Southern Politics'' (2012) p. 303</ref>

In the end, Goldwater received 38.4% of the popular vote, and carried just six states: Arizona (with 50.45% of the popular vote) and the core states of the [[Deep South]]: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. In carrying Georgia by a margin of 54–45%, Goldwater became the first Republican nominee to win the state. However, the overall result was the worst showing in terms of popular vote and electoral college vote for any post-World War II Republican.

In all, Johnson won an overwhelming 486 electoral votes, to Goldwater's 52. Goldwater, with his customary bluntness, remarked, "We would have lost even if Abraham Lincoln had come back and campaigned with us." He maintained later in life that he would have won the election if the country had not been in a state of extended grief (referring to the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]]), and that it was simply not ready for a third President in just 14 months.

Goldwater's poor showing pulled down many supporters. Of the 57 Republican Congressmen who endorsed Goldwater before the convention, 20 were defeated for reelection, along with many promising young Republicans. On the other hand, the defeat of so many older politicians created openings for young conservatives to move up the ladder. While the loss of moderate Republicans was temporary—they were back by 1966—Goldwater also permanently pulled many conservative Southerners and white ethnics out of the [[New Deal Coalition]].<ref>Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' 232-37</ref>

"In the South, Goldwater broke through and won five states—the best showing in the region for a GOP candidate since Reconstruction. In Mississippi—where Franklin D. Roosevelt had won nearly 100 percent of the vote just 28 years earlier—Goldwater claimed a staggering 87 percent."<ref>Kornacki, Steve (February 3, 2011) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/02/03/reagan_southern_strategy/index.html The "Southern Strategy", fulfilled], ''[[Salon (journal)|Salon]]'' {{Wayback|url=http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/02/03/reagan_southern_strategy/index.html|date =20110413151441}}</ref> It has frequently been argued that Goldwater's strong performance in Southern states previously regarded as Democratic strongholds foreshadowed a larger shift in electoral trends in the coming decades that would make the South a Republican bastion (an end to the "[[Solid South]]")—first in presidential politics and eventually at the congressional and state levels, as well.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Rodriguez |author2=Weingast, Barry |title=How the GOP Helped the Democrats Destroy the Solid South |date=July 2006 |publisher=Stanford University |url=http://politicalscience.stanford.edu/faculty/documents/weingast-untold%20story%20of%201964%20civil%20rights%20act.pdf |accessdate =January 7, 2007 |format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716153517/http://politicalscience.stanford.edu/faculty/documents/weingast-untold%20story%20of%201964%20civil%20rights%20act.pdf|archivedate=July 16, 2011}}</ref>

=== Return to US Senate ===
Goldwater remained popular in Arizona, and in the [[U.S. Senate election, 1968|1968 Senate election]] he was elected (this time) to the seat of retiring Senator [[Carl Hayden]]. He was subsequently reelected in 1974 and 1980. The [[United States Senate elections, 1974|1974]] election saw Goldwater easily reelected over his Democratic opponent, [[Jonathan Marshall]], the publisher of ''The Scottsdale Progress''. His final campaign in 1980 was close, with Goldwater winning in a near draw against Democratic challenger Bill Schulz. Goldwater said later that the close result convinced him not to run again.<ref>{{Citation | url = //www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsuxC6Ft92I | title = YouTube | publisher = Google| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101104112917/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsuxC6Ft92I&feature=youtu.be| archivedate = November 4, 2010}}</ref>

=== Retirement ===
Goldwater seriously considered retirement in [[U.S. Senate election, 1980|1980]] before deciding to run for reelection. Peggy Goldwater reportedly hoped that her husband's Senate term, due to end in January 1981, would be his last. Goldwater decided to run, planning to make the term his last in the Senate. Goldwater faced a surprisingly tough battle for reelection. He was viewed by some as out of touch and vulnerable for several reasons; most importantly, because he had planned to retire in 1981, Goldwater had not visited many areas of Arizona outside of Phoenix and Tucson. He was also challenged by a formidable opponent, Bill Schulz, a former Republican turned Democrat and a wealthy [[real estate]] developer. Schulz was able to infuse massive amounts of money into the campaign from his own fortune.

Arizona's changing population also hurt Goldwater. The state's population had soared, and a huge portion of the electorate had not lived in the state when Goldwater was previously elected; hence, many voters were less familiar with Goldwater's actual beliefs, and he was on the defensive for much of the campaign. Early returns on election night seemed to indicate that Schulz would win. The counting of votes continued through the night and into the next morning. At around daybreak, Goldwater learned that he had been reelected thanks to [[absentee ballot]]s, which were among the last to be counted.{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | at = chapter 12}} Goldwater's surprisingly close victory in 1980 came despite Reagan's 61% landslide over [[Jimmy Carter]] in Arizona. Republicans regained control of the Senate, putting Goldwater in the most powerful position he ever had in the Senate.

Goldwater retired in 1987, serving as chair of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees in his final term. Despite his reputation as a firebrand in the 1960s, by the end of his career he was considered a stabilizing influence in the Senate, one of the most respected members of either major party. Though Goldwater remained staunchly anti-communist and "hawkish" on military issues, he was a key supporter of the fight for ratification of the [[Panama Canal Treaty]] in the 1970s, which would give control of the canal zone to the Republic of [[Panama]]. His most important legislative achievement may have been the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]], which reorganized the US military's senior-command structure.

==Policies==
Goldwater became most associated with labor-union reform and anti-communism; he was an active supporter of the [[conservative coalition]] in Congress.  His work on labor issues led to Congress passing major anti-corruption reforms in 1957, and an all-out campaign by the [[AFL-CIO]] to defeat his 1958 reelection bid. He voted against the censure of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in 1954, but he never actually charged any individual with being a communist/Soviet agent. Goldwater emphasized his strong opposition to the worldwide spread of communism in his 1960 book ''[[Conscience of a Conservative|The Conscience of a Conservative]]''. The book became an important reference text in conservative political circles.

[[File:President Johnson and Senator Goldwater.jpg|thumb|President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] with Senator Goldwater, January 16, 1964]]
In 1964, Goldwater ran a conservative campaign that emphasized states' rights.{{Sfn | Donaldson | 2003 | p = 20}}  Goldwater's 1964 campaign was a magnet for conservatives since he opposed interference by the federal government in state affairs. Although he had supported all previous federal civil rights legislation and had supported the original senate version of the bill, Goldwater made the decision to oppose the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. His stance was based on his view that the act was an intrusion of the federal government into the affairs of states and that the Act interfered with the rights of private persons to do or not do business with whomever they chose.{{Sfn | Donaldson | 2003 | pp = 152–79}} In the segregated city of Phoenix in the 1950s, he had quietly supported civil rights for blacks, but would not let his name be used.<ref>Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'' (1995) pp. 88–90</ref>

All this [[Southern strategy|appealed to white Southern Democrats]], and Goldwater was the first Republican to win the electoral votes of all of the Deep South states ([[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]]) since  [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]<ref name="Bernard Cosman 1966">{{Citation | first = Bernard | last = Cosman | title = Five States for Goldwater: Continuity and change in Southern presidential voting patterns | year = 1966}}</ref> (although Dwight Eisenhower did carry Louisiana in 1956). However, Goldwater's vote on the Civil Rights Act proved devastating to his campaign everywhere outside the South (besides Dixie, Goldwater won only in Arizona, his home state), contributing to his landslide defeat in 1964.

While Goldwater had been depicted by his opponents in the Republican primaries as a representative of a  [[conservatism|conservative philosophy]] that was extreme and alien, his voting records show that his positions were in harmony with those of his fellow Republicans in the Congress. What distinguished him from his predecessors was, according to [[Hans J. Morgenthau]], his firmness of principle and determination, which did not allow him to be content with mere rhetoric.<ref>{{Citation | first = Hans J | last = Morgenthau | title = Goldwater – The Romantic Regression | newspaper = Commentary |date=September 1964}}</ref>

Goldwater fought in 1971 to stop US funding of the [[United Nations]] after the [[People's Republic of China]] was admitted to the organization. He said:
{{quote | I suggested on the floor of the Senate today that we stop all funds for the United Nations. Now, what that'll do to the United Nations, I don't know. I have a hunch it would cause them to fold up, which would make me very happy at this particular point. I think if this happens, they can well move their headquarters to Peking or Moscow and get 'em out of this country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/#title |title= Red China Admitted to UN: 1971 Year in Review |agency=United Press International |date=December 28, 1971 |accessdate=March 3, 2012|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5gYCwI4ba |archivedate = May 5, 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref>}}

===Political relationships===
Goldwater was grief-stricken{{Sfn | Goldwater | 1980 | p = 161 | ps =: "When that assassin's bullet ended the life of John Fitzgerald Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963, it was for me a great personal loss."}} by the [[John F.

Nixon]] of California (whom he later called "the most dishonest individual I have ever met in my life").<ref name="test"/> After Goldwater again became a senator, he urged Nixon to resign at the height of the [[Watergate]] scandal, warning that fewer than ten senators would vote against conviction if Nixon were impeached by the House of Representatives.{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | p = 282}} The term "Goldwater moment" has since been used to describe situations when influential members of Congress disagree so strongly with a president from their own party that they openly oppose him.

===Goldwater and the revival of American conservatism===
Although Goldwater was not as important in the [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] movement as [[Ronald Reagan]] after 1965, he shaped and redefined the movement from the late 1950s to 1964. Arizona Senator [[John McCain]], who had succeeded Goldwater in the Senate in 1987, summed up Goldwater's legacy, "He transformed the Republican Party from an Eastern elitist organization to the breeding ground for the election of Ronald Reagan."<ref>{{cite news | last = Grove | first = Lloyd | title = Barry Goldwater's Left Turn | work = The Washington Post | date = July 28, 1994 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater072894.htm | accessdate =October 25, 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131213230145/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater072894.htm | archivedate = December 13, 2013 }}</ref> Columnist [[George Will]] remarked after the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 Presidential election]] that it took 16 years to count the votes from 1964 and Goldwater won.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/05/AR2008110503927.html |title=What Would Goldwater Do?|work=The Washington Post|first=George|last=Will|authorlink=George Will|date=November 6, 2008 |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}</ref>

The Republican Party recovered from the 1964 election debacle, picking up 47 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the [[U.S. House election, 1966|1966 mid-term election]]. Further Republican successes ensued, including Goldwater's return to the Senate in 1968. In January of that year, Goldwater wrote an article in the ''[[National Review]]'' "affirming that he [was] not against liberals, that liberals are needed as a counterweight to conservatism, and that he had in mind a fine liberal like [[Max Lerner]]".<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N.]]. [https://www.mises.org/story/1842 "Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal]". [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]. {{Wayback|url=https://www.mises.org/story/1842|date =20090430200846}}</ref>

Goldwater was a strong supporter of the environment. He explained his position in 1969:
{{Quote|I feel very definitely that the [Nixon] administration is absolutely correct in cracking down on companies and corporations and municipalities that continue to pollute the nation's air and water. While I am a great believer in the free competitive enterprise system and all that it entails, I am an even stronger believer in the right of our people to live in a clean and pollution-free environment.

Throughout the 1970s, as the conservative wing under Reagan gained control of the party, Goldwater concentrated on his Senate duties, especially in military affairs. He played little part in the election or administration of [[Richard Nixon]], but he helped force Nixon's resignation in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,942972,00.html |title=The Last Week: The Unmaking of the President |work=Time |date=August 19, 1974 |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140514223419/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,942972,00.html |archivedate=May 14, 2014 }}</ref> In 1976 he helped block Rockefeller's renomination as vice president. When Reagan challenged Ford for the presidential nomination in 1976, Goldwater endorsed Ford, looking for consensus rather than conservative idealism.

In 1979, when President Carter normalized relations with [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], Goldwater and some other senators sued him in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], arguing that the president could not terminate the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty]] with [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) without the approval of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]]. The case, ''[[Goldwater v. Carter]]'', was dismissed by the court as a [[political question]].

==Later life==
[[File:Goldwater1983.jpg|thumb|right|Signing autographs at the Fiesta Bowl parade in 1983.]]
By the 1980s, with [[Ronald Reagan]] as president and the growing involvement of the [[Christian right|religious right]] in conservative politics, Goldwater's [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] views on personal issues were revealed; he believed that they were an integral part of true conservatism. Goldwater viewed [[abortion]] as a matter of personal choice and supported as such abortion rights.{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | p = 331}}

As a passionate defender of personal liberty, he saw the religious right's views as an encroachment on personal privacy and [[Civil liberties|individual liberties]].{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | p = 315}}  In his 1980 Senate reelection campaign, Goldwater won support from [[religious conservative]]s but in his final term voted consistently to uphold legalized abortion and, in 1981, gave a speech on how he was angry about the bullying of American politicians by religious organizations, and would "fight them every step of the way".<ref>{{Citation | url = http://pieceofmind.wordpress.com/2006/11/10/wwbd-what-would-barry-do/ | title = Piece of mind | contribution = WWBD: What Would Barry Do | publisher = Word press | date = November 10, 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205651/http://pieceofmind.wordpress.com/2006/11/10/wwbd-what-would-barry-do/ | archivedate = October 29, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Goldwater | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = September 17, 1981 | title = The 'New Right' Has Nothing to Do with the 'Old Conservatism'}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | page = 39 | title = [[The God Delusion]]}}</ref> Goldwater also disagreed with the Reagan administration on certain aspects of foreign policy (for example, he opposed the decision to [[CIA activities in Nicaragua#Nicaragua 1981|mine Nicaraguan harbors]]). Notwithstanding his prior differences with [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], Goldwater in a 1986 interview rated him the best of the seven Presidents with whom he had worked.

He introduced the [[1984 Cable Franchise Policy and Communications Act]], which allowed local governments to require the transmission of [[public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) channels, barred cable operators from exercising editorial control over content of programs carried on PEG channels, and absolved them from liability for their content.

On May 12, 1986, Goldwater was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Ronald Reagan]].

After his retirement in 1987, Goldwater described the Arizona Governor [[Evan Mecham]] as "hardheaded" and called on him to resign, and two years later stated that the Republican party had been taken over by a "bunch of kooks".{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | p = 329}}

He is a 1987 recipient of the [[Langley Gold Medal]] from the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. In 1988, in recognition of his career, [[Princeton University]]'s [[American Whig-Cliosophic Society]] awarded Goldwater the [[James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://archives-trim.un.org/webdrawer/rec/552938/view/Item-in-KAA%20Schoolsuniversities%202002%20-%20oct.%20-%20dec..PDF | title = Item in KAA | format  = PDF | publisher = UN| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121226142153/http://archives-trim.un.org/webdrawer/rec/552938/view/Item-in-KAA%20Schoolsuniversities%202002%20-%20oct.%20-%20dec..PDF | archivedate = December 26, 2012 }}</ref>

In a 1994 interview with the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the retired senator said,

Goldwater visited the small town of [[Bowen, Illinois]] in 1989 to see first hand where his mother was raised.

In response to [[Moral Majority]] founder [[Jerry Falwell]]'s opposition to the nomination of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass."<ref>{{Citation | first = Ed | last = Magnuson | newspaper = [[Time Magazine|Time]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954833-2,00.html | title = The Brethren's First Sister | date = July 20, 1981 | accessdate = January 1, 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130521021206/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954833-2,00.html | archivedate = May 21, 2013 }}</ref><ref>Goldberg, ''Barry Goldwater'', p. 315</ref> (According to [[John Dean]], Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the "nuts", but the news media "changed the anatomical reference."<ref>{{Citation | last = Dean | first = John | title = Broken Government | year = 2008 | publisher = Penguin}}</ref>{{Rp | needed = yes | date =July 2013}}) Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] became public in 1986. Journalist [[Robert MacNeil]], a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward.  "He was sitting in his office with his hands on his cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the [[Iran]] arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?'

Some of Goldwater's statements in the 1990s alienated many [[social conservatives]]. He endorsed Democrat [[Karan English]] in an Arizona congressional race, urged Republicans to lay off [[Bill Clinton]] over the [[Whitewater scandal]], and criticized [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell|the military's ban on homosexuals]]:<ref name="left_turn" /> "Everyone knows that gays have served honorably in the military since at least the time of [[Julius Caesar]]."<ref>{{Citation | title = Ban On Gays Is Senseless Attempt To Stall The Inevitable | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | url = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/scotts/bulgarians/barry-goldwater.html | publisher = CMU| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121021062721/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/scotts/bulgarians/barry-goldwater.html | archivedate = October 21, 2012 }}</ref> He also said, "You don't need to be 'straight' to fight and die for your country.

==Hobbies and interests==

===Amateur radio===
Goldwater was an avid [[amateur radio]] operator from the early 1920s onwards, with the [[call sign]]s 6BPI, K3UIG and K7UGA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smecc.org/barry_goldwater.htm |title=An Afternoon with Senator Goldwater |publisher=Smecc.org |accessdate=March 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104212755/http://www.smecc.org/barry_goldwater.htm|archivedate=January 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=262314 |title=FCC K7UGA record |publisher=Wireless2.fcc.gov |date=May 29, 1998 |accessdate=March 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104205451/http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=262314 |archivedate=January 4, 2014 }}</ref> The latter is now used by an Arizona club honoring him as a commemorative call. During the [[Vietnam War]], he spent many hours giving servicemen overseas the ability to talk to their families at home over the [[Military Affiliate Radio System]] (MARS).

Goldwater was also a prominent spokesman for amateur radio and its enthusiasts. Beginning in 1969 up to his death he appeared in numerous educational and promotional films (and later videos) about the hobby that were produced for the [[American Radio Relay League]] (the United States national society representing the interests of radio amateurs) by such producers as Dave Bell (W6AQ), ARRL Southwest Director John R. Griggs (W6KW), Alan Kaul (W6RCL), Forrest Oden (N6ENV), and the late Roy Neal (K6DUE). His first appearance was in Dave Bell's "The World of Amateur Radio" where Goldwater discussed the history of the hobby and demonstrated a live contact with Antarctica. His last on-screen appearance dealing with "ham radio" was in 1994, explaining a then-upcoming, Earth-orbiting ham radio relay satellite.

Electronics were a hobby for Goldwater beyond amateur radio. He enjoyed assembling [[Heathkit]]s, completing more than 100 and often visiting their maker in [[Benton Harbor, Michigan]] to buy more, before the company exited the kit business in 1992.<ref name="fisher">Fisher, Lawrence M.

===Kachina dolls===
[[File:Kachina Dolls Heard Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Over half of the kachina dolls at the Heard Museum were donated by Goldwater]]
In 1916, Goldwater visited the [[Hopi]] [[Indian Reservation|Reservation]] with Phoenix architect John Rinker Kibby, and obtained his first [[Hopi Kachina dolls|kachina doll]]. Eventually his doll collection included 437 items and was presented in 1969 to the [[Heard Museum]] in Phoenix.<ref name="kachina">{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special25/articles/1203goldwater2.html |title=Goldwater Kachinas a public treasure |work=The Arizona Republic |date=December 3, 1986 |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}</ref>

===Photography===
Goldwater was an amateur [[photographer]] and in his estate left some 15,000 of his images to three Arizona institutions. He was very keen on [[candid photography]]. He got started in photography after receiving a camera as a gift from his wife on their first Christmas together. He was known to use a [[Large format|4x5]] [[Graflex]], [[Rolleiflex]], 16&nbsp;mm Bell and Howell motion picture camera, and [[135 film|35 mm]] [[Nikkormat#Nikkormat FT|Nikkormat FT]]. He was a member of the [[Royal Photographic Society]] from 1941 becoming a Life Member in 1948.<ref>Information provided by The Royal Photographic Society, United Kingdom, dated October 6, 2011, [http://www.rps.org "Royal Photographic Society"]. {{Wayback|url=http://www.rps.org|date =20140402035959}}</ref>

For decades, he contributed photographs of his home state to ''[[Arizona Highways (magazine)|Arizona Highways]]'' and was best known for his Western landscapes and pictures of [[native Americans in the United States]]. Three books with his photographs are ''People and Places'', from 1967; ''Barry Goldwater and the Southwest'', from 1976; and ''Delightful Journey'', first published in 1940 and reprinted in 1970. [[Ansel Adams]] wrote a foreword to the 1976 book.<ref>''Arizona Republic'', May 31, 1998</ref>

Goldwater's photography interests occasionally crossed over with his political career, as well. [[John F. Kennedy]], as president, was known to invite former congressional colleagues to the White House for a drink. On one occasion, Goldwater brought his camera and photographed President Kennedy. When Kennedy received the photo, he returned it to Goldwater, with the inscription, "For Barry Goldwater – Whom I urge to follow the career for which he has shown such talent – photography! – from his friend – John Kennedy." This quip became a classic of American political humor after it was made famous by humorist [[Bennett Cerf]]. The photo itself was prized by Goldwater for the rest of his life, and recently sold for $17,925 in a [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=6047&Lot_No=47197 |title=Heritage Auctions description of signed Kennedy photo |publisher=Historical.ha.com |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=March 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221045509/http://historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=6047&Lot_No=47197 |archivedate=February 21, 2011 }}</ref>

Son Michael Prescott Goldwater formed the Goldwater Family Foundation with the goal of making his father's photography available via the internet. ([http://www.barrygoldwaterphotographs.com ''Barry Goldwater Photographs'']) was launched in September 2006 to coincide with the HBO documentary ''"Mr. Conservative"'', produced by granddaughter CC Goldwater.

===UFOs===

On March 28, 1975, Goldwater wrote to Shlomo Arnon: "The subject of UFOs has interested me for some long time. About ten or twelve years ago I made an effort to find out what was in the building at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] where the information has been stored that has been collected by the Air Force, and I was understandably denied this request. It is still classified above Top Secret."<ref name="anomalies.net"/> Goldwater further wrote that there were rumors the evidence would be released, and that he was "just as anxious to see this material as you are, and I hope we will not have to wait much longer."<ref name = "anomalies.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.anomalies.net/archive/Text-Archive/txt1/469.ufo |title=FOIA documents | publisher = Anomalies |accessdate=March 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307074012/http://www.anomalies.net/archive/Text-Archive/txt1/469.ufo |archivedate=March 7, 2012 }}</ref>

The April 25, 1988, issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' carried an interview where Goldwater said he repeatedly asked his friend, Gen. [[Curtis LeMay]], if there was any truth to the rumors that UFO evidence was stored in a secret room at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], and if he (Goldwater) might have access to the room. According to Goldwater, an angry LeMay gave him "holy hell" and said, "Not only can't you get into it but don't you ever mention it to me again."<ref>{{cite news| first = Burton | last = Bernstein | title = AuH2O | newspaper = The New Yorker | date = April 25, 1988 | page = Profiles, p. 43 |nopp=y}}</ref>

In a 1988 interview on [[Larry King]]'s radio show, Goldwater was asked if he thought the U.S. Government was withholding UFO evidence; he replied "Yes, I do." He added:
{{quote | I certainly believe in aliens in space. They may not look like us, but I have very strong feelings that they have advanced beyond our mental capabilities...

==Goldwater Scholarship==
The [[Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship]] and Excellence in Education Program was established by Congress in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|title=Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Program|url=http://www.act.org/goldwater/|publisher=ACT, Inc|accessdate=August 21, 2013}}</ref> Its goal is to provide a continuing source of highly qualified scientists, mathematicians, and engineers by awarding scholarships to college students who intend to pursue careers in these fields.

The Scholarship is widely considered the most prestigious award in the U.S. conferred upon undergraduates studying the sciences. It is awarded to about 300 students (college sophomores and juniors) nationwide in the amount of $7500 per academic year (for their senior year, or junior and senior years).<ref>{{cite web|title=Bulletin of Information for the 2013–2014 Competition|url=http://www.act.org/goldwater/yybull.html|publisher=Goldwater Scholarship Program|accessdate=August 21, 2013}}</ref> It honors Goldwater's keen interest in science and technology.

==Death==
Goldwater's public appearances ended in late 1996 after he suffered a massive stroke; family members then disclosed he was in the early stages of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He died on May 29, 1998, at the age of 89 at his long-time home in [[Paradise Valley, Arizona]], of complications from the stroke.<ref>Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, [http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000267 ''Goldwater, Barry Morris, (1909–1988)''].

Senator Goldwater was an occasional roaster on the [[Dean Martin]] roasts of the mid-1970s.

In his song "[[I Shall Be Free No. 10]]", [[Bob Dylan]] refers to Goldwater: "I'm liberal to a degree, I want everybody to be free. But if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater move in next door and marry my daughter, you must think I'm crazy."
