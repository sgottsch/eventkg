'''Persecution of Christians''' can be traced [[History of Christianity|historically]] based on the biblical account of [[Jesus]] in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century]] of the [[Christian era]] to the [[Christianity in the 21st century|present time]]. [[Early Christianity|Early Christians]] were persecuted for their [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] at the hands of both [[Persecution of Christians by the Jews|Jews]] from [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|whose religion Christianity arose]] and the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]] which controlled much of the [[Early centers of Christianity|land across which early Christianity was distributed]]. [[Christianity in the 4th century|Early in the fourth century]], the religion was legalized by the [[Edict of Milan]], and it eventually became the [[State church of the Roman Empire]].

[[Christian missionaries]], as well as the people that they converted to Christianity, have been the target of [[persecution]], sometimes to the point of being [[Martyrdom|martyred for their faith]]. There is also a history of individual [[Christian denominations]] suffering persecution at the hands of other Christians under the charge of [[Heresy in Christianity|heresy]], particularly during the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation]] as well as throughout the Middle Ages when various Christian groups deemed heretical were persecuted by the Papacy.

In the 20th century, Christians have been persecuted by various groups, including by [[state atheism|atheistic states]] such as the [[USSR]] and [[North Korea]]. During the [[Second World War]] members of some Christian churches were persecuted in [[Germany]] for resisting [[Nazi]] ideology.

In more recent times the Christian missionary organization [[Open Doors]] (UK) estimates 100&nbsp;million Christians face persecution, particularly in [[List of Muslim-majority countries|Middle Eastern countries]] such as [[Pakistan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref>[[Open Doors]]: [http://www.opendoorsuk.org/resources/country_profiles.php The worst 50 countries for persecution of Christians]</ref><ref>Open Doors: [http://www.opendoors-de.org/downloads/wvi/weltverfolgungsindex2012.pdf Weltverfolgungsindex 2012], p. 2</ref>

===Persecution of Christians in the New Testament===
{{main|Persecution of Christians in the New Testament}}
[[Early Christianity]] began as a sect among [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple Jews]], and according to the New Testament account, [[Pharisees]], including [[Paul of Tarsus]] prior to his conversion to Christianity, persecuted early Christians. The early Christians preached of a Messiah which [[Jewish view of Jesus|did not conform]] with their [[Jewish Messianism|religious teachings]].<ref>Wand, John Williams Charles [http://books.google.com/books?id=ci2hvwXqlKMC&vq=contents&dq A History of the Early Church to AD 500], p. 12, Routledge 1990</ref> However, feeling that their beliefs were supported in Jewish scripture, Christians had been hopeful that their countrymen would accept their faith.<ref name="books.google.com"/> Despite individual conversions, the vast majority of Judean Jews did not become Christians.<ref name="books.google.com">Wand, John Williams Charles [http://books.google.com/books?id=ci2hvwXqlKMC&vq=contents&dq A History of the Early Church to AD 500], p. 13, Routledge 1990</ref>

Claudia Setzer asserts that, "Jews did not see Christians as clearly separate from their own community until at least the middle of the second century."  Thus, acts of Jewish persecution of Christians fall within the boundaries of synagogue discipline and were so perceived by Jews acting and thinking as the established community. The Christians, on the other hand, saw themselves as persecuted rather than "disciplined."<ref>{{cite book|author=Claudia Setzer |title=Jewish Responses to Early Christians: History and Polemics, 30-150 C.E. |publisher=Fortress |location=Minneapolis |year=1994}}</ref>

[[File:Caravaggio-Crucifixion of Peter.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Crucifixion of St. Peter'' by [[Caravaggio]]]] Inter-communal dissension began almost immediately with the teachings of [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]] at Jerusalem, who was considered an apostate.<ref name="books.google.com"/> According to [[Acts of the Apostles]], a year after the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], Stephen was stoned for his alleged transgression of the faith,<ref name="Characteristics Of The Early Church">Burke, John J., [http://books.google.com/books?id=o2W01eeEzaoC&dq Characteristics Of The Early Church], p.101, Read Country Books 2008</ref> with [[Paul of Tarsus|Saul]] (who later converted and was renamed ''Paul'') looking on.

In 41&nbsp;AD, when [[Agrippa I]], who already possessed the territory of Antipas and Phillip, obtained the title of ''King of the Jews'', in a sense re-forming the [[Herodian kingdom|Kingdom of Herod]], he was reportedly eager to endear himself to his Jewish subjects and continued the persecution in which [[James the Greater]] lost his life, Peter narrowly escaped and the rest of the apostles took flight.<ref name="books.google.com"/>

After Agrippa's death, the Roman procuratorship began (before 41 they were [[Prefects]] in [[Iudaea Province]]) and those leaders maintained a neutral peace, until the procurator Festus died and the high priest Annas II took advantage of the power vacuum to attack the Church and executed [[James the Just]], then leader of [[First Christian church|Jerusalem's Christians]].<ref name="books.google.com"/> The New Testament states that [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] was himself imprisoned on several occasions by Roman authorities, stoned by Pharisees and left for dead on one occasion, and was eventually taken as a prisoner to Rome. [[St. Peter|Peter]] and other early Christians were also imprisoned, beaten and harassed. A Jewish revolt, spurred by the Roman killing of 3,000 Jews, led to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70&nbsp;AD, the end of sacrificial Judaism (until the [[Third Temple]]), and the disempowering of the Jewish persecutors; the Christian community, meanwhile, having fled to safety in the already pacified region of [[Pella, Jordan|Pella]].<ref name="books.google.com"/>

The [[New Testament]], especially the [[Gospel of John]], has traditionally been interpreted as relating Christian accounts of [[Rejection of Jesus#Jewish rejection|the Pharisee rejection of Jesus]] and accusations of [[Responsibility for the death of Jesus|the Pharisee responsibility for his crucifixion]]. [[Luke Timothy Johnson|Luke T. Johnson]] nuances the harsh portrayal of the Jews in the Gospels by contextualizing the polemics within the rhetoric of contemporaneous philosophical debate, showing how rival schools of thought routinely insulted and slandered their opponents. These attacks were formulaic and stereotyped, crafted to define who was the enemy in the debates, but not used with the expectation that their insults and accusations would be taken literally, as they would be centuries later, resulting in millennia of [[Christian antisemitism]].<ref>Johnson, Luke T. "The New Testament's Anti-Jewish Slander and the Conventions of Ancient Polemic." Journal of Biblical Literature 108.3 (1989): 419-441</ref>

[[Walter Laqueur]] argues that hostility between Christians ande generations. By the 4th century, [[John Chrysostom]] was arguing that the Pharisees alone, not the Romans, were [[Jewish deicide|responsible for the murder of Jesus]]. However, according to Laqueur: "Absolving [[Pilate]] from guilt may have been connected with the missionary activities of early Christianity in Rome and the desire not to antagonize those they want to convert."<ref>[[Walter Laqueur]] (2006): ''The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day'', Oxford University Press.

===Persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire===

[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus315.png|thumb|300px|Persecution of the Christians.]]

{{Main|Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire}}

====Persecution under Nero, 64–68&nbsp;AD====
{{Main|Great Fire of Rome}}

The first documented case of imperially supervised persecution of the Christians in the [[Roman Empire]] begins with [[Nero]] (37–68). In 64&nbsp;AD, a [[Great Fire of Rome|great fire broke out in Rome]], destroying portions of the city and economically devastating the Roman population. Some people suspected Nero himself as the arsonist, as [[Suetonius]] reported,<ref>Nero Ch 38</ref> claiming he played the lyre and sang the 'Sack of [[Troy|Ilium]]' during the fires. In his ''Annals'', [[Tacitus]] (who wrote that Nero was in Antium at the time of the fire's outbreak), stated that "''to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians'' (or Chrestians)<ref>In the earliest extant manuscript, the second Medicean, the ''e'' in "Chrestianos", Chrestians, has been changed into an ''i''; cf. Gerd Theißen, Annette Merz, ''Der historische Jesus: ein Lehrbuch'', 2001, p. 89. The reading ''Christianos'', Christians, is therefor doubtful. On the other hand, Suetonius (Claudius 25) uses the same "e" transliteration of the Greek Krystos, meaning the anointed one, and associates it with a troublemaker among the Jews</ref> ''by the populace''" (Tacit. ''Annals'' XV, see [[Tacitus on Jesus]]). Suetonius, later to the period, does not mention any persecution after the fire, but in a previous paragraph unrelated to the fire, mentions punishments inflicted on Christians, defined as men following a new and malefic superstition. Suetonius however does not specify the reasons for the punishment, he just lists the fact together with other abuses put down by Nero.<ref>Nero 16</ref>

====Persecution from the 2nd century to Constantine====
By the mid-2nd century AD, mobs could be found willing to throw stones at Christians, and they might be mobilized by rival sects. The [[Persecution in Lyon]] in which Christians were mass-slaughtered by being thrown to wild beasts under the decree of Roman officials for reportedly refusing to renounce their faith according to [[Irenaeus|St. Irenaeus]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianhistoryproject.org/to-the-decian-persecution/irenaeus/|title=IRENAEUS â— The mass slaughter of Lyon’s Christians|work=Christian History Project}}</ref> was preceded by mob violence, including assaults, robberies and stonings.<ref>Christopher Reyes (2010). ''In His Name''. California: AuthorHouse. p.33</ref>

Further state persecutions were desultory until the 3rd century, though [[Tertullian]]'s ''[[Apologeticus]]'' of 197 was ostensibly written in defense of persecuted Christians and addressed to Roman governors.<ref>Tertullian's readership was more likely to have been Christians, whose faith was reinforced by Tertullian's defenses of faith against rationalizations.</ref> The "edict of [[Septimius Severus]]" familiar in Christian history is doubted by some secular historians to have existed outside Christian [[martyrology]].

The first documentable Empire-wide persecution took place under [[Maximinus Thrax]], though only the clergy were sought out. It was not until [[Decius]] during the mid-century that a persecution of Christian laity across the Empire took place. Christian sources aver that a decree was issued requiring public sacrifice, a formality equivalent to a testimonial of allegiance to the Emperor and the established order. Decius authorized [[roving commission]]s visiting the cities and villages to supervise the execution of the sacrifices and to deliver written certificates to all citizens who performed them. Christians were often given opportunities to avoid further punishment by publicly offering sacrifices or burning incense to Roman gods, and were accused by the Romans of impiety when they refused. Refusal was punished by arrest, imprisonment, torture, and executions. Christians fled to safe havens in the countryside and some purchased their certificates, called ''libelli.'' Several councils held at [[Carthage]] debated the extent to which the community should accept these lapsed Christians.

Some early Christians sought out and welcomed martyrdom. Roman authorities tried hard to avoid Christians because they "goaded, chided, belittled and insulted the crowds until they demanded their death."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ide|first1=Arthur Frederick|authorlink1=Arthur F.

According to two different traditions, Bar-Kokhba, the commander of the second Jewish revolt against Rome (132-135 AD), persecuted the Christians: Justin claims that Christians were punished if they did not deny and blaspheme Jesus Christ, while Eusebius asserts that Bar-Kokhba harassed them because they refused to join him against the Romans.<ref>Justin, I ''Apology'' 31, 6; Eusebius, ''Chronicle'', seventeenth year of the Emperor Hadrian.

====The Great Persecution====
{{Main|Diocletian Persecution}}
[[File:Herbert schmalz28.jpg|300px|thumb|"Faithful Unto Death" by Herbert Schmalz]]

The persecutions culminated with [[Diocletian]] and [[Galerius]] at the end of the third and beginning of the 4th century. The [[Great Persecution]] is considered the largest. Beginning with a series of four edicts banning Christian practices and ordering the imprisonment of Christian clergy, the persecution intensified until all Christians in the empire were commanded to sacrifice to the [[Roman gods]] or face immediate execution. Over 20,000 Christians are thought to have died during Diocletian's reign. One of the most prominent [[martyrs]] during the Dioclecian persecution was [[Saint George]], a Roman soldier who loudly renounced the Emperor's edict, and in front of his fellow soldiers and tribunes claimed himself to be a Christian by declaring his worship of [[Jesus Christ]]. Diocletian attempted to convert George, even offering gifts of land, money and slaves if he made a sacrifice to the Roman gods; he made many offers, but George never accepted and was subsequently tortured and decapitated.<ref>Margaret Gibbs, 1947. Saints Beyond the White Cliff (Biography index reprint series). First Edition Edition. Ayer Co Pub.</ref> Though [[Diocletian]] zealously persecuted Christians in the Eastern part of the empire, his co-emperors in the West did not follow the edicts and so Christians in Gaul, Spain, and Britannia were virtually unmolested.

This persecution lasted until [[Constantine I]] came to power in 313 and legalized Christianity. It was not until [[Theodosius I]] in the later 4th century that Christianity would become the official religion of the Empire. Between these two events [[Julian the Apostate|Julian II]] temporarily restored the traditional Roman religion and established broad religious tolerance renewing Pagan and Christian hostilities.

Martyrs were considered uniquely exemplary of the Christian faith, and few early saints were not also martyrs.

The ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' states that "Ancient, medieval and early modern hagiographers were inclined to exaggerate the number of martyrs. Since the title of martyr is the highest title to which a Christian can aspire, this tendency is natural". Estimates of Christians killed for religious reasons before the year 313 vary greatly, depending on the scholar quoted, from a low of 10,000 to a high of almost 100,000.

In AD 341, the [[Zoroastrian]] [[Shapur II]] ordered the massacre of all Christians in the [[Persia]]n [[Sassanid Empire]]. During the persecution, about 1,150 [[Assyrian Christian]]s were martyred under Shapur II in [[Assuristan]] (Sassanid ruled Assyria).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/Caption.asp?FSID=101122 |title=OCA - Hieromartyr Simeon the Bishop in Persia, and those with him in Persia |publisher=Ocafs.oca.org |date=17 April 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref> In the 4th century, the [[Thervings|Terving]] king [[Athanaric]]

In AD 516, a tribal unrest broke out in [[Yemen]] and several tribal elites fought for power, one of those elites was Joseph [[Dhu Nuwas]] or "Yousef Asa'ar", a Jewish warlord as mentioned in ancient south Arabian inscriptions. [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]] and [[Byzantium]] sources claim that he fought his way because Christians in Yemen refused to renounce Christianity. In 2009, a documentary that aired on [[BBC]] defended the claim that the villagers had been offered the choice between conversion to Judaism or death and that 20,000 Christians had then been massacred stating that "The production team spoke to many historians over 18 months, among them Nigel Groom, who was our consultant, and Professor Abdul Rahman Al-Ansary, a former professor of archaeology at the [[King Saud University]] in Riyadh."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/historians-back-bbc-over-jewish-massacre-claim|title=Historians back BBC over Jewish massacre claim |work= The Jewish Chronicle|accessdate= 30 March 2015}}</ref> Inscriptions documented by Yousef himself shows the great pride he expressed after Killing more than 22,000 Christians in Zafar and [[Najran]].<ref>Jacques Ryckmans, La persécution des chrétiens himyarites au sixième siècle Nederlands Historisch-Archaeologisch Inst. in het Nabije Oosten, 1956 pp 1–24</ref> Historian [[Glen Bowersock]] described this as "savage pogrom that the Jewish king of the Arabs launched against the Christians in the city of Najran.

===Persecution of Christians by Persians and Jews during Roman-Persian Wars===
{{Main| Sasanian conquest and occupation of Jerusalem}}

Several months after the Persian conquest in AD 614, a riot occurred in Jerusalem, and the Jewish governor of Jerusalem Nehemiah was killed by a band of young Christians along with his "council of the righteous" while making plans for the building of the [[Third Temple]]. At this time the Christians had allied themselves with the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]]. Shortly, the events escalated into a full-scale Christian rebellion, resulting in a battle of Jews and Christians inside Jerusalem. In the aftermath many Jews were killed and survivors fled to Caesarea, still held by the Persian Army.

The Judeo-Persian reaction was ruthless—Persian Sasanian general Xorheam assembled Judeo-Persian troops and went and encamped around Jerusalem and besieged in for 19 days.<ref name=abrahamson>{{cite web|url=http://www.alsadiqin.org/history/The%20Persian%20conquest%20of%20Jerusalem%20in%20614CE%20compared%20with%20Islamic%20conquest%20of%20638CE.pdf|format=PDF|author=Abrahamson |title=The Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614 compared with Islamic conquest of 638|website=alsadiqin.org|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Eventually, digging beneath the foundations of the Jerusalem, they destroyed the wall and on the 19th day of the siege, the Judeo-Persian forces took Jerusalem.<ref name=abrahamson/>

In general, Christians subject to Islamic rule were allowed to practice their religion with some notable limitations stemming from the [[Covenant of Umar I|Pact of Umar]]. This treaty, enacted in 717 AD, forbade Christians from publicly displaying the cross on church buildings, summoning congregants to prayer by a bell, re-building churches in case they were destroyed, and other restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pact of Umar |work=Christian History |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/2002/issue74/jul26.html |accessdate= 24 March 2015}}</ref> Native Christian communities are subject to persecution in several [[Muslim-majority countries]] such as Egypt,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/634399/the-fate-of-egypts-coptic-christians-part-one-with-raymond-ibrahim/ |title=The Fate Of Egypt’s Coptic Christians: Part One With Raymond Ibrahim|accessdate= 24 March 2015}}</ref> Pakistan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianfreedom.org/the-christian-winter/persecution-in-pakistan/ |title=Persecution In Pakistan |work=Christian Freedom International|accessdate= 24 March 2015}}</ref> and Saudi Arabia still implementing -to a varying degree- some of the guidelines redacted in that document.

As [[People of the Book]] Christians were awarded [[dhimmi]] status (along with [[Jews]] and [[Mandeans]]), inferior to the status of Muslims.

At times, anti-Christian pogroms occurred. Under [[sharia]], non-Muslims were obligated to pay [[jizya]] taxes, which contributed a significant proportion of income for the Islamic state and persuaded many Christians to convert to Islam.<ref>Norman A. Stillman, 1998. Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book. Edition. The Jewish Publication Society.</ref> According to the [[Hanafi]] school of sharia, the testimony of a non-Muslim (such as a Christian) was not considered valid against the testimony of a Muslim. Other schools differed. Christian men were not allowed to marry a Muslim woman under sharia. Muslim men on the other hand were allowed to marry Christian women who were then expected to convert.
Christians under Islamic rule had the right to convert to Islam or any other religion, while a [[murtad]], or apostate of Islam, faced severe penalties or even [[hadd]], which could include the death penalty.

[[Tamerlane]] instigated large scale massacres of Christians in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persia]], [[Asia Minor]] and [[Syria]] in the 14th century AD. Most of the victims were indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Armenians]], members of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Orthodox Churches]], which led to the decimation of the hitherto majority Assyrian population in northern Mesopotamia and the abandonment of the ancient Assyrian city of [[Ashur]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Khanbaghi|first=Aptin|title=The fire, the star and the cross: minority religions in medieval and early modern Iran|year=2006|publisher=I.B.Tauris|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7iAbUEaXnfEC&pg=PA87|isbn=9781845110567}}</ref>

The Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution is a conventional description of a campaign, conducted by various [[Robespierre]]-era governments of France beginning with the start of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, to eliminate any symbol that might be associated with the past, especially the [[Monarchy of France|monarchy]].

The program included the following policies:<ref>Latreille, A.

* the deportation of clergy and the condemnation of many of them to death,
* the closing, [[desecration]] and pillaging of churches, removal of the word "saint" from street names and other acts to banish Christian culture from the public sphere
* removal of statues, plates and other iconography from places of worship
* destruction of crosses, bells and other external signs of worship
* the institution of revolutionary and civic cults, including the [[Cult of Reason]] and subsequently the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]],
* the large scale destruction of religious monuments,
* the outlawing of public and private worship and religious education,
* forced marriages of the clergy,
* forced abjurement of priesthood, and
* the enactment of a law on 21 October 1793 making all nonjuring priests and all persons who harbored them liable to death on sight.

Under threat of death, imprisonment, military conscription or loss of income, about 20,000 constitutional priests were forced to abdicate or hand over their letters of ordination and 6,000&nbsp;– 9,000 were coerced to marry, many ceasing their ministerial duties.<ref name="google">Tallet, Frank [http://books.google.com/books?id=aL4lsWdd-rAC&dq Religion, Society and Politics in France Since 1789] p. 10, 1991 Continuum International Publishing</ref> Some of those who abdicated covertly ministered to the people.<ref name="google"/> By the end of the decade, approximately 30,000 priests were forced to leave France, and thousands who did not leave were executed.<ref>Lewis, Gwynne [http://books.google.com/books?id=VjXHmc6Z5ZcC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=dechristianisation+of+france+during+the+french+revolution&source=web&ots=8NNRjFA4Fr&sig=CpEiqD7wOPrORg7aWTcHX4CnL7w The French Revolution: Rethinking the Debate] p.96 1993

The relationship between Muslims and Christians have been occasionally turbulent. With the advent of European colonialism in India throughout the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Christians were systematically persecuted in a few Muslim ruled kingdoms in India. Modern day persecution also exists carried out by Hindu nationalists. A report by Human Rights Watch stated that there is a rise of anti-Christian violence due to Hindu nationalism and Smita Narula, Researcher, Asia Division of Human Rights Watch stated "Christians are the new scapegoat in India's political battles.

[[File:James Scurry.jpg|thumb|left|The British officer [[James Scurry]], who was detained a prisoner for 10 years by Tipu Sultan along with the Mangalorean Catholics]]
Tipu Sultan's invasion of the [[Malabar Coast]] had an adverse impact on the [[Saint Thomas Christian]] community of the Malabar coast. Many churches in Malabar and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. Many centuries-old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Saint Thomas Christians were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Saint Thomas Christian farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.<ref name= Bernard >K.L. Bernard, ''Kerala History '', pp. 79</ref>

Tipu's persecution of Christians also extended to captured British soldiers. For instance, there were a significant amount of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the [[battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref>William Dalrymple ''White Mughals'' (2006) p28</ref>

During the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Many of the Christians in Japan continued for two centuries to maintain their religion as [[Kakure Kirishitan]], or hidden Christians, without any priests or pastors. Some of those who were killed for their Faith are venerated as the [[Martyrs of Japan]].

Christianity was later allowed during the [[Meiji era]]. The [[Meiji Constitution]] of 1890 introduced [[separation of church and state]] and permitted freedom of religion.

===Ottoman Empire===
{{Main|Armenian genocide|Assyrian genocide|Greek genocide}}Relations between Muslims and Christians in the Ottoman Empire during the modern era were shaped in no small part by broader dynamics related to European colonial and neo-imperialist activity in the region, dynamics that frequently (though by no means always) generated tensions between the two. Too often, growing European influence in the region during the nineteenth century seemed to disproportionately benefit Christians, thus producing resentment on the part of many Muslims, likewise a suspicion that Christians were colluding with the European powers to weaken the Islamic world. Further exacerbating relations was the fact that Christians seemed to benefit disproportionately from efforts at reform (one aspect of which generally sought to elevate the political status of non-Muslims), likewise, the various Christian nationalist uprisings in the Empire's European territories, which often had the support of the European powers.<ref>Erik Freas, Muslim-Christian Relations in Late-Ottoman Palestine: Where Nationalism and Religion Intersect (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016), ISBN 1137570415</ref>

A major massacre of [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Armenians]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] occurred between 1894 and 1897 AD by [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] troops and their [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] supporters during the rule of [[Sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]] (the [[Hamidian massacre]]). The motives for these massacres were an attempt to reassert [[Pan-Islamism]] in the Ottoman Empire, resentment at the comparative wealth of the ancient indigenous Christian communities, and a fear that they would attempt to secede from the tottering Ottoman Empire. Assyrians and Armenians were massacred in [[Diyarbakir]], [[Hasankeyef]], [[Sivas]] and other parts of Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia, by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. These attacks caused the death of tens of thousands of Assyrians and Armenians and the forced "Ottomanisation" of the inhabitants of 245 villages. The Turkish troops looted the remains of settlements and these were later stolen and occupied by Muslim [[Kurds]]. Unarmed Christian women and children were raped, tortured and murdered.<ref name="aua"/>

The [[Young Turks]] government of the collapsing [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1915 persecuted [[Eastern Christianity|Christian]] populations in [[Anatolia]], [[Persia]] and Northern [[Mesopotamia]]. The onslaught by the Ottoman army, including Kurdish and Circassian irregulars resulting in an estimated 2.5 million deaths, divided between roughly 1.2 million [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Christians]], 0.75 million [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and 0.75 million [[Greek Orthodox Christians]]; a number of [[Georgians]] were also killed. The Genocide led to the devastation of ancient indigenous Christian peoples who had existed in the region for thousands of years.<ref>The Plight of Religious Minorities: Can Religious Pluralism Survive? – Page 51 by United States Congress</ref><ref>The Armenian Genocide: Wartime Radicalization Or Premeditated Continuum – Page 272 edited by Richard Hovannisian</ref><ref>Not Even My Name: A True Story – Page 131 by Thea Halo</ref><ref>The Political Dictionary of Modern Middle East by Agnes G.

After the Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks undertook a massive program to remove the influence of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] from the government while outlawing antisemitism in Russian society, and promoting state [[atheist|atheism]]. Tens of thousands of churches were destroyed or converted to other uses, and many members of clergy were murdered, including public executions and imprisonment for what the government termed "anti-government activities." An extensive education and propaganda campaign was undertaken to convince people, especially the children and youth, to abandon religious beliefs. This persecution resulted in the intentional murders of 500,000 Orthodox followers in the 20th century by the Soviet Union.<ref name = "russian orthodox killed"/>

This persecution affected the Orthodox. It also affected other groups, such as the [[Mennonite]]s, who largely fled to [[the Americas]].<ref name=sovmenno>{{cite web|author=Ruslan V.

Before and after the October Revolution of 7 November 1917 (25 October Old Calendar) there was a movement within the Soviet Union to unite all of the people of the world under Communist rule (see [[Communist International]]). This included the Eastern European bloc countries as well as the Balkan States. Since some of these Slavic states tied their ethnic heritage to their ethnic churches, both the peoples and their church were targeted for ethnic and political genocide by the Soviets and its form of [[State atheism]].<ref>President of Lithuania: Prisoner of the Gulag a Biography of [[Aleksandras Stulginskis]] by Afonsas Eidintas Genocide and Research Center of Lithuania ISBN 9986-757-41-X / 9789986757412 / 9986-757-41-X pg 23 "As early as August 1920 [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] wrote to [[Ephraim Sklyansky|E.

The Communist regime confiscated church property, ridiculed religion, harassed believers, and propagated atheism in the schools. Actions toward particular religions, however, were determined by State interests, and most organized religions were never outlawed. It is estimated that 500,000 Russian [[Orthodox Christians]] were [[martyred]] in the [[gulag]]s by the Soviet government, not including torture or other [[Christian denominations]] killed.<ref name="russian orthodox killed">World Christian trends, AD 30-AD 2200, p.230-246 Tables 4–5 & 4–10 By David B.

[[File:Christ the Savior Cathedral Moscow from a bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Christ the Savior Cathedral Moscow]] after reconstruction]]
The main target of the anti-religious campaign in the 1920s and 1930s was the Russian Orthodox Church, which had the largest number of faithful. A very large segment of its clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labor camps. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1940, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested.
The widespread persecution and internecine disputes within the church hierarchy lead to the seat of [[Patriarch of Moscow]] being vacant from 1925 to 1943.

After Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957 about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959 Nikita Khrushchev initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. By 1985 fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.<ref name=Ostling/>

In the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closing and destruction of churches, the charitable and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by the state. As with all private property, Church owned property was confiscated into public use. The few places of worship left to the Church were legally viewed as state property which the government permitted the church to use. After the advent of state funded universal education, the Church was not permitted to carry on educational, instructional activity for children. For adults, only training for church-related occupations was allowed. Outside of sermons during the celebration of the divine liturgy it could not instruct or evangelise to the faithful or its youth. Catechism classes, religious schools, study groups, Sunday schools and religious publications were all illegal and or banned. This caused many religious tracts to be circulated as illegal literature or [[samizdat]].<ref name="google"/> This persecution continued, even after the death of Stalin until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Orthodox Church has recognized a number of [[New-martyr|New Martyrs]] as saints, some executed during [[Mass operations of the NKVD]] under directives like [[NKVD Order No. 00447]].

===19th and 20th century Mexico===
{{Main|Persecution of Christians in Mexico}}
In the 19th century, Mexican President [[Benito Juárez]] confiscated church lands. The [[Mexican government]]'s campaign against the Catholic Church after the [[Mexican Revolution]] culminated in the 1917 constitution which contained numerous articles which Catholics perceived as violating their civil rights: outlawing monastic religious orders, forbidding public worship outside of church buildings, restricted religious organizations' rights to own property, and taking away basic civil rights of members of the clergy (priests and religious leaders were prevented from wearing their habits, were denied the right to vote, and were not permitted to comment on public affairs in the press and were denied the right to trial for violation of [[anticlerical]] laws). When the first embassy of the Soviet Union in any country was opened in Mexico, the Soviet ambassador remarked that "no other two countries show more similarities than the Soviet Union and Mexico".<ref>Krauze, Enrique, [http://books.google.com/books?id=sMIUcsUVyzsC&pg=PA418&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Mexico: biography of power : a history of modern Mexico, 1810–1996''], p. 418, Harper Collins 1998</ref>

When the Church publicly condemned the anticlerical measures which had not been strongly enforced, the atheist President [[Plutarco Calles]] sought to vigorously enforce the provisions and enacted additional anti-Catholic legislation known as the Calles Law. At this time, some in the United States government, considering Calles' regime [[Bolshevik]], started to refer to Mexico as "Soviet Mexico".<ref>Richards, Michael D.

Weary of the persecution, in many parts of the country a popular rebellion called the [[Cristero War]] began (so named because the rebels felt they were fighting for Christ himself). The effects of the persecution on the Church were profound. Between 1926 and 1934 at least 40 priests were killed.<ref name="ewtn">Van Hove, Brian [http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/FR94204.TXT ''Blood-Drenched Altars''] Faith & Reason 1994</ref> Where there were 4,500 priests serving the people before the rebellion, in 1934 there were 334 priests licensed by the government to serve fifteen million people, the rest having been eliminated by emigration, expulsion and assassination.<ref name="ewtn"/><ref>Scheina, Robert L.

The [[Latter Day Saint Movement]], ([[Mormons]]) have been persecuted since their founding in the 1830s. This persecution drove them from New York and [[Ohio]] to [[Missouri]], where they continued to suffer violent attacks. In 1838, Gov.

===Madagascar===
[[File:Christian martyrs burned at the stake in Madagascar.jpg|thumb|180px|Christian martyrs [[burned at the stake]] by Ranavalona I in Madagascar]]
Queen [[Ranavalona I]] (reigned 1828–1861) issued a royal edict prohibiting the practice of [[Christianity]] in [[Madagascar]], expelled British missionaries from the island, and sought to [[Persecution of Christians in Madagascar|stem the growth of conversion]] to Christianity within her realm. Many Malagasy citizens were put to death during this period as a consequence of their refusal to recant their Christian faith.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Far more, however, were punished in other ways: many were required to undergo the ''[[tangena]]'' ordeal, while others were condemned to hard labor or the confiscation of their land and property, and many of these consequently died. The tangena ordeal was commonly administered to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused person for any crime, including the practice of Christianity, and involved ingestion of the poison contained within the nut of the tangena tree (''[[Cerbera odollam]]''). Survivors were deemed innocent, while those who perished were assumed guilty.

In 1838, it was estimated that as many as 100,000 people in Imerina died as a result of the ''tangena'' ordeal, constituting roughly 20% of the population.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Campbell | first = Gwyn | date = October 1991 | title = The state and pre-colonial demographic history: the case of nineteenth century Madagascar | journal = Journal of African History | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 415–445 | ref = harv}}</ref> contributing to a strongly unfavorable view of Ranavalona's rule in historical accounts.<ref name="Laidler 2005">Laidler (2005)</ref> [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] Christians would remember this period as ''ny tany maizina'', or "the time when the land was dark".

===Spain===
{{Main|Red Terror (Spain)}}
The Second Republic proclaimed in 1931 attempted to establish a regime with a separation between State and Church as it had happened in France (1905), where Church had to finance itself, had full responsibility and freedom to elect its own bishops, and had to foster religious education outside formal schooling, unlike the Spanish Monarchy up to 1931. When established, the Republic passed a number of laws that prompted big progress in education, but it also challenged the power of Church, impregnating virtually all levels of life in Spain, and entrenched values and traditional public ceremonies. The different Church institutions shifted towards ever more [[Manichaean]] positions, presenting the situation resulting from the proclamation of the 2nd Republic as an anti-Catholic, Masonic, Jewish, and Communist international conspiracy that heralded a clash between God and atheism, chaos and harmony, Good and Evil.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dronda |first=Javier |date=2013 |title=Con Cristo o contra Cristo: Religión y movilización antirrepublicana en Navarra (1931-1936)|url= |location=Tafalla |publisher=Txalaparta |pages=201–202 |isbn=978-84-15313-31-1 |accessdate= }}</ref> The Church's high-ranking officials like Isidro Goma, bishop of [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], reminded their Christian subjects of their obligation to vote "for the righteous" (specific right and far-right options), and their priests to "educate the consciences."<ref>{{cite book |last=Dronda |first=Javier |date=2013 |title=Con Cristo o contra Cristo|url= |location=Tafalla |publisher=Txalaparta |page=220 |isbn=978-84-15313-31-1 |accessdate= }}</ref>

A like ''catastrophist'' approach is attested since way earlier, in 1912, when the bishop of Almería José Ignacio de Urbina (founder of the National anti-Masonic and anti-Semitic League) announced 'a decisive battle that must be unleashed' between the "light" and "darkness."<ref>{{cite book | author=Paul Preston | title=The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain. | publisher= HarperCollins | location= London, UK | isbn=978-0-00-638695-7 | year=2013 | page=4}}</ref> Since the early stages of the [[2nd Spanish Republic]], far-right forces imbued with an ultra-Catholic spirit attempted to overthrow the Republic by violence.

Persecution of Catholics mostly, before and at the beginning, of the Spanish Civil war (1936–1939), involved the murder of almost 7,000 priests and other clergy, as well as thousands of lay people, by sections of nearly all the leftist groups because of their faith.<ref name="links.jstor.org">[[Julio de la Cueva]], [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-0094%28199807%2933%3A3%3C355%3ARPATAR%3E2.0.CO%3B2-O "Religious Persecution, Anticlerical Tradition and Revolution: On Atrocities against the Clergy during the Spanish Civil War"] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 33.3 (July 1998): 355.</ref><ref>Payne, Stanley G., [http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne26.htm A History of Spain and Portugal] p. 647</ref>

During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, and especially in the early months of the conflict, individual clergymen and entire religious communities were executed by leftists, which included communists and anarchists. The [[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|death toll of the clergy]] alone included 13 bishops, 4,172 diocesan priests and seminarians, 2,364 monks and friars and 283 nuns, for a total of 6,832 clerical victims.<ref name="links.jstor.org"/>

In addition to murders of clergy and the faithful, destruction of churches and desecration of sacred sites and objects were widespread. On the night of 19 July 1936 alone, some fifty churches were burned.<ref>David Mitchell, ''The Spanish Civil War'' (New York: Franklin Watts, 1983), 45.</ref> In [[Barcelona]], out of the 58 churches, only the Cathedral was spared, and similar desecrations occurred almost everywhere in Republican Spain.<ref>David Mitchell, ''The Spanish Civil War'' (New York: Franklin Watts, 1983), 46.</ref>

Exceptions were [[Biscay]] and [[Gipuzkoa]] where the [[Christian Democratic]] [[Basque Nationalist Party]], after some hesitation, supported the Republic while halting persecution in the areas held by the [[Basque Government]].
All Catholic churches in the Republican zone were closed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The desecration was not limited to Catholic churches, as synagogues and Protestant churches were also pillaged and closed.

===Nazi Germany===
Hitler and the Nazis had some support from Christian communities, mainly due to a common cause against the anti-religious Communists, as well as to mutual [[Judeophobia]] and antisemitism. Once in power, the Nazis moved to consolidate their power over the German churches and bring them in line with Nazi ideals.

Thus, the Nazi government consolidated religious power, using allies to consolidate Protestant churches into the [[Protestant Reich Church]]. The [[syncretist]] project of Positive Christianity was abandoned by 1940.

Like other intelligentsia, Christian leaders were sometimes persecuted for anti-Nazi political activities. Between 1939 and 1945, an estimated 3,000 members, 18% of the Polish clergy, were murdered for suspected ties to the Polish Resistance or left-wing groups, or for sheltering Jews (punishable by death). Outside mainstream Christianity, [[Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witnesses]] were targets of Nazi Persecution, for their refusal to swear allegiance to the Nazi government. Many Jehovah's Witnesses were given the chance to swear allegiance to the state, but few agreed. Over 12,000 Witnesses were sent to concentration camps, and estimated 2,500–5,000 died.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

[[File:Buchenwald Slave Laborers Liberation.jpg|thumb|The [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] is one of the camps in which Jehovah's Witnesses prisoners labored.]]
Since [[Charles Taze Russell]]'s [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Bible Students]] group had formed after the [[American Civil War]] there was no formal position on military service till 1914, when the body came out against military service. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] are forbidden by their religion to engage in violence, or to join the military.

In Nazi Germany in the 1930s and early 1940s, Jehovah's Witnesses refused to renounce political neutrality and were [[Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany|placed in concentration camps]] as a result. The Nazi government gave detained Jehovah's Witnesses the option of release by signing a document indicating renouncement of their faith, submission to state authority, and support of the German military.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust-trc.org/PRJW.htm|title=Persecution and Resistance of Jehovah’s Witnesses During the Nazi-Regime 1938-1945|publisher=}}</ref>

Historian Hans Hesse said, "Some five thousand Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to concentration camps where they alone were 'voluntary prisoners', so termed because the moment they recanted their views, they could be freed. Some lost their lives in the camps, but few renounced their faith".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hesse|first=Hans|title=Persecution and resistance of Jehovah's Witnesses during the Nazi regime, 1933–1945|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mcxD0qxHMO0C|accessdate=6 April 2011|year=2001

Political and religious animosity against Jehovah's Witnesses has at times led to [[mob action]] and government oppression in various countries, including [[Human rights in Cuba|Cuba]], the [[Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in the United States|United States]], [[Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Canada|Canada]] and [[Religion in Singapore#Christianity|Singapore]].

Christians have faced increasing levels of persecution in the Muslim world. Muslim nations in which Christian populations have suffered acute discrimination, persecution and in some cases death include; [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Palestinian Territories]], [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Turkey]], [[Libya]], [[Yemen]], [[Sudan]], [[Somalia]], [[Qatar]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Nigeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Jordan]], [[Oman]], [[Algeria]], [[Mali]], [[Kuwait]], [[Morocco]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Niger]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Tadjikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Mauritania]], [[Eritrea]], [[Bahrain]], [[Comoros]], [[Djibouti]], [[Brunei]], [[Tanzania]], [[Maldives]], [[Kenya]], [[Chad]] and [[United Arab Emirates]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnd.com/2014/01/37-muslim-nations-persecuting-christians/|title=37 Muslim nations persecuting Christians|work=WND}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/531468/Prince-Charles-Muslim-Christian-Islamic-State-IS|title=Prince Charles urges Muslim leaders to 'show tolerance' over persecution of Christians|author=Richard Palmer|work=Express.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Report-charting-persecution-of-Christians-worldwide-reveals-most-abuse-in-Muslim-countries-338682|title=Report: Persecution of Christians reveals most abuse in Muslim countries|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}</ref>

Furthermore, any Muslim person—including any person born to a Muslim family or having become Muslim at a given point in life—who converts to Christianity is considered to have performed [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]]. Apostasy, the conscious abandonment of Islam by a Muslim in word or through deed, including also conversion to Christianity, is punishable as a crime under the [[Application of sharia law by country|application of the Sharia]]. There are, however, cases in which a Muslim will adopt the Christian faith, secretly without declaring his/her apostasy. As a result, they are practising Christians, but legally Muslims, and would face the death penalty. [[Meriam Ibrahim]], a Sudanese woman, was sentenced to death for apostasy in 2014, because the government of Sudan classified her as a Muslim, while she was raised Christian.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27586067 Sudanese woman facing death for apostasy gives birth], BBC, 27 May 2014</ref>

On the night of 26–27 March 1996, seven [[monks]] from the monastery of [[Tibhirine]] in [[Algeria]], belonging to the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Trappist]] Order of [[Cistercian]]s of the Strict Observance (O.C.S.O.), were kidnapped in the [[Algerian Civil War]]. They were held for two months, and were found dead on 21 May 1996. The circumstances of their kidnapping and death remain controversial; the [[Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA) allegedly took responsibility for both, but the then French military attaché, retired General [[Francois Buchwalter]], reports that they were accidentally killed by the Algerian army in a rescue attempt, and claims have been made that the GIA itself was a [[wikt:cat's-paw|cat's paw]] of Algeria's secret services ([[Département du Renseignement et de la Sécurité|DRS]]).

Radical Islamists allegedly looted, and burned to the ground, a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] church in [[Tizi Ouzou]] on 9 January 2010.

Foreign missionaries are allowed in the country if they restrict their activities to social improvements and refrain from [[proselytizing]]. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] [[Pope Shenouda III]] was internally exiled in 1981 by President [[Anwar Sadat]], who then chose five Coptic bishops and asked them to choose a new pope. They refused, and in 1985 President [[Hosni Mubarak]] restored Pope Shenouda III, who had been accused of fomenting interconfessional strife. Particularly in Upper Egypt, the rise in extremist [[Islamist]] groups such as the [[Gama'at Islamiya]] during the 1980s was accompanied by increased attacks on Copts and on Coptic Orthodox churches; these have since declined with the decline of those organizations, but still continue. The police have been accused of siding with the attackers in some of these cases.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/589977.stm |title=Funerals for victims of Egypt clashes |publisher=BBC News |date=4 January 2000 |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref>

In July 2012, [[Dahshur]]'s entire Christian community, which some estimate to be as many as a hundred families, fled to nearby towns due to sectarian violence. The violence began in a dispute over a badly ironed shirt, which in turn escalated into a fight in which a Christian burned a Muslim to death, which in turn sparked a rampage by angry Muslims, while the police failed to act. At least 16 homes and properties of Christians were pillaged, some were torched, and a church was damaged during the violence.<ref name="Riot leaves christians">{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/riot-leaves-egyptian-village-christians-16930420 | title=Riot leaves an Egyptian village without Christians | publisher=ABC News | agency=Associated Press | date=4 August 2012 | accessdate=5 August 2012 | author=El Deeb, Sarah}}</ref>

By the end of the 13th century there were twelve [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] dioceses in a strip from [[Peking]] to [[Samarkand]]. When the 14th-century Muslim warlord of Turco-Mongol descent, [[Timur]] (Tamerlane), conquered [[Persia]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Syria]], the civilian population was decimated.

However persecution by [[Saddam Hussein]] continued against the Christians on an [[ethnic]], cultural and racial level, as the vast majority are Mesopotamian [[Eastern Aramaic]] speaking Ethnic Assyrians (aka [[Chaldo-Assyrians]]). The Assyrian -Aramaic language and written script was repressed, the giving of Hebraic/Aramaic Christian names or [[Akkadian]]/[[Assyro-Babylonian]] names forbidden ([[Tariq Aziz]]'s real name is Michael Youhanna for example), and Saddam exploited religious differences between Assyrian denominations such as [[Chaldean Catholics]], [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]], in an attempt to divide them. Many Assyrians and Armenians were ethnically cleansed from their towns and villages under the [[al Anfal Campaign]] in 1988, despite this campaign being aimed primarily at Kurds.

Syria has been home to Christianity from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE onwards. The majority of Syrian Christians are once [[Western Aramaic]] speaking but now largely Arabic speaking [[Assyrian people|Arameans-Syriacs]], with smaller minorities of [[Eastern Aramaic]] speaking [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Armenians]] also extant. While religious persecution has been relatively low level compared to other Middle Eastern nations, many of the Christians have been pressured into identifying as Arab Christians, with the Assyrian and Armenian groups retaining their native languages.

During the [[Syrian Civil War]], [[Genocide of Christians by ISIL]] and other militant groups has been ongoing. Some 13 nuns and three workers from a Greek Orthodox monastery in the Christian village of Maaloula were also kidnapped.

The Orthodox population of Turkey was substantially reduced as a result of the [[Greek genocide]] preceding and during [[World War I]]. Additionally, the vast majority of Greek Orthodox Christians were forced to leave the territory of Turkey in a population swap following the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]. Included among that transfer were many Turkish speaking Christians, who were nonetheless sent to Greece. After years of persecution (e.g. the [[Varlık Vergisi]] and the [[Istanbul Pogrom]]), [[emigration]] Greek Orthodox from the Istanbul region greatly accelerated, reducing the 119,822

The [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] is still in a difficult position.

The state's expropriation of church property and the closing of the Orthodox [[Halki seminary|Theological School of Halki]] are also difficulties faced by the Church of Constantinople. Despite appeals from the United States, the [[European Union]] and various governmental and non-governmental organizations, the School remains closed since 1971. In November 2007, a 17th-century chapel of ''Our Lord's Transfiguration'' at the Halki seminary was almost totally demolished by the Turkish forestry authority.<ref>[http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=10827&size=A Halki’s Chapel of the Transfiguration left in ruins] AsiaNews.it, 17 November 2007</ref> There was no advance warning given for the demolition work and it was stopped after appeals by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]].<ref>[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100013_16/11/2007_90155 Monastery on Halki wrecked] Kathimerini, English Edition, 16 November 2007.</ref>

In December 2015, Islamic extremists belonging to al-Shabab ambushed a bus travelling through [[Mandera]] in Kenya. They told the Muslims and Christians passangers to split up, that they were going to kill the Christian passengers. However, the Muslim passengers refused it, shielding the Christians. At least two people were killed in the attack and three others were injured.

The establishment of [[French Indochina]] once led to a high Christian population. Regime changes throughout the 19th and 20th centuries led to some increased persecution of minority religious groups. Killings, torture or imprisonment and forced starvation of local groups are common in parts of Vietnam and Laos, especially in more recent years.<ref>{{cite news|last=AFP|first=Google|title=Laos, Vietnam troops kill four Hmong Christians: NGO|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5idxNnRhkVWwnlTrzWBGgekWQhYLQ|accessdate=6 May 2011|newspaper=Agence France-Presse|date=15 April 2011}}</ref>

During the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015, 12 Christian migrants from Nigeria and Ghana, among 105 migrants travelling in an inflatable boat from Libya, were drowned after being pushed overboard by 15 other passengers from the Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and Guinea Bissau. The motive was that the victims "professed the Christian faith while the aggressors were Muslim." The surviving Christians formed a "human chain" to resist the assault. The 15 suspected were arrested in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], and charged with "multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate" by the Italian authorities.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Messia|first1=Hada|last2=Borghese|first2=Livia|last3=Hanna|first3=Jason|title=Italian police: Muslim migrants threw Christians overboard|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/16/europe/italy-migrants-christians-thrown-overboard/|accessdate=2 April 2016|work=[[CNN]]|date=19 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Winfield|first1=Nicole|title=Police: Muslims threw Christians overboard during Med voyage|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/aid-agency-says-41-migrants-feared-dead-sea-142032667.html|accessdate=2 April 2016|work=[[Yahoo!
