'''MSN''' (stylized as '''msn''') is a [[web portal]] and related collection of [[Internet]] services and [[Mobile app|apps]] for [[Windows]] and [[mobile devices]], provided by [[Microsoft]] and launched on August 24, 1995, the same release date as [[Windows 95]].<ref name="about-timeline">{{cite web|url=http://webtrends.about.com/od/profi3/p/Microsoft-bio.htm |title=Microsoft timeline and profile |publisher=[[About.com]] Web Trends |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref>

Along with Windows 95's release, Microsoft debuted '''[[MSN Dial-up|The Microsoft Network]]''', a subscription-based [[dial-up]] [[online service]] that it later turned into an [[Internet service provider]] named [[MSN Dial-up]]. At the same time, the company launched a new web portal named '''Microsoft Internet Start''' and set it as the first default [[home page]] of [[Internet Explorer]], its original [[web browser]]. In 1998, Microsoft renamed and moved this web portal to the [[domain name]] '''MSN.com''', where it has remained since then.<ref name="msn96ecom">{{cite web | url=http://ecommerce.hostip.info/pages/734/Microsoft-Network-MSN-MSN-WORKS-FIND-ITS-FOCUS.html | title=MSN works to find its focus | accessdate=2009-08-07}}</ref>

In addition to its original [[MSN Dial-up]] service, Microsoft has used the 'MSN' brand name for [[list of services by MSN|a wide variety of products and services]] over the years, notably [[Hotmail]] (which is now [[Outlook.com]]), [[Windows Live Messenger|Messenger]] (which was once synonymous with 'MSN' in [[Internet slang]] and has now been replaced by [[Skype]]), and its [[search engine]] (which is now [[Bing]]), as well as [[list of services by MSN|several other rebranded and discontinued services]].

The current website and suite of apps offered by MSN was first introduced by Microsoft in 2014 as part of a complete redesign and relaunch.<ref name="msn2014relaunch">{{cite news |last=Bishop|first=Todd |date=September 30, 2014 |title=MSN's rebirth brings Microsoft's new approach into focus |url=http://www.geekwire.com/2014/msns-rebirth-brings-microsofts-new-approach-focus|newspaper=GeekWire|accessdate=2014-10-01 }}</ref> MSN is based in the [[United States]] and offers international versions of its portal for dozens of countries around the world.<ref name="msnworldwide">{{cite web |title=MSN Worldwide |url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/msn-worldwide|accessdate=2015-04-10 }}</ref>

== Website ==

===Microsoft Internet Start===
[[File:Msncom-1996.png|thumb|MSN.com in October 1996, with the logo used from 1995 to 1998.]]

From 1995 to 1998, the [http://www.msn.com/ MSN.com] domain was used by Microsoft primarily to promote [[MSN Dial-up|MSN as an online service and Internet service provider]]. At the time, MSN.com also offered a custom start page and an Internet tutorial, but Microsoft's major [[web portal]] was known as 'Microsoft Internet Start,' located at [http://home.microsoft.com/ home.microsoft.com].

Internet Start served as the default [[home page]] for [[Internet Explorer]] and offered basic information such as news, weather, sports, stocks, entertainment reports, links to other websites on the Internet, articles by Microsoft staff members, and software updates for Windows. Microsoft's original news website, [[msnbc.com]] (now [[NBCNews.com]]), which launched in 1996, was also tied closely to the Internet Start portal.

===MSN.com===
In 1998, the largely underutilized 'MSN.com' [[domain name]] was combined with Microsoft Internet Start and reinvented as both a [[web portal]] and as the brand for a family of sites produced inside Microsoft's Interactive Media Group. The new website put MSN in direct competition with sites such as [[Yahoo!]] and [[Go Network]]. Because the new format opened up MSN's content to the world for free, the Internet service provider and subscription service was renamed [[MSN Dial-up|MSN Internet Access]] at that time. (That service eventually became known as [[MSN Dial-up]].)<ref name="msn96ecom" />

The relaunched MSN.com contained a whole family of sites, including original content, channels that were carried over from 'web shows' that were part of Microsoft's [[MSN Dial-up#MSN 2.0|MSN 2.0]] experiment with [[MSN Dial-up|its Internet service provider]] in 1996-97, and new features that were rapidly added. MSN.com became the successor to the default Internet Explorer start page, as all of the previous 'Microsoft Internet Start' website was merged with MSN.com.<ref name="msn96ecom" />

Some of the original websites that Microsoft launched during that era remain active in some form today. Microsoft Investor, a [[Business journalism|business news]] and [[investments]] service that was once produced in conjunction with [[CNBC]], is now MSN Money;<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cnbc-on-msn-moneys-stockscouter-celebrates-two-year-track-record-of-outperforming-standard--poors-500-70756152.html |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |title=CNBC on MSN Money's StockScouter Celebrates Two-Year Track Record Of Outperforming Standard & Poor's 500 |date=8 July 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/msn-money-same-microsoft-money-20698.html |publisher=[[AZ Central]] |title=Is MSN Money the Same as Microsoft Money? |date=5 December 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://money.msn.com/investing/an-epic-bear-market-is-coming/ |publisher=[[MSN Money]] |title=Savings and investing - MSN Money |date=14 Oct 2014}}</ref> CarPoint, an [[automobile]] comparison and shopping service, is now MSN Autos; and the Internet Gaming Zone, a website offering online [[casual games]], is now [[MSN Games]]. Other websites since divested by Microsoft include the travel website [[Expedia]], the online magazine [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], and the local event and city search website [[Sidewalk.com]].

[[File:MSN logo.svg|thumb|The former MSN 'butterfly' logo used from 2000 to 2009.]]
In the late 1990s, Microsoft collaborated with many other service providers, as well as other Microsoft departments, to expand the range of MSN's services. Some examples include [[Bing Ads|MSN adCenter]], [[MSN Shopping]] (affiliated with [[eBay]], [[PriceGrabber]] and [[Shopping.com]]), and the [[Encarta]] encyclopedia with various levels of access to information.

Since then, MSN.com has remained a popular destination, launching many new services and content sites. MSN's [[Hotmail]] and [[Microsoft Messenger service|Messenger]] services were promoted from the MSN.com portal, which provided a central place for all of MSN's content. [[MSN Search]] (now [[Bing]]), a dedicated [[Web search engine|search engine]], launched in 1999. The single sign-in service for Microsoft's online services, [[Microsoft account|Microsoft Passport]] (now [[Microsoft account]]), also launched across all MSN services in 1999. The MSN.com portal and related group of services under the 'MSN' umbrella remained largely the same in the early 2000s.

The sports section of the MSN portal was [[ESPN.com]] from 2001 to 2004, and [[FoxSports.com]] from 2004 to 2014.<ref>[http://www.ciol.com/ciol/news/112941/espncom-msn-tie-online-sports-coverage ESPN.com, MSN tie up for online sports coverage] - CIOL, 8 September 2001</ref><ref>[http://news.cnet.com/Game-on-for-MSN,-FoxSports-site/2100-1026-5250774.html Game on for MSN, Fox Sports site] - CNET, 28 June 2004</ref> MSN had an exclusive partnership with [[msnbc.com]] for news content from 1996 until 2012, when Microsoft sold its remaining stake in msnbc.com to [[NBCUniversal]] and the website was renamed [[NBCNews.com]]. Since then, MSN has launched 'MSN News', an in-house news operation.<ref name="msnbcnbc">{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/business/media/msnbccom-renamed-nbcnewscom-as-microsoft-and-nbc-divorce.html?_r=0 |title=Microsoft and NBC Complete Web Divorce |accessdate=2014-07-21 | work=[[New York Times]] |date=2012-07-15}}</ref>

[[File:New MSN.svg|thumb|The former MSN 'butterfly' logo used from 2009 to 2014.]]
MSN released a preview of its an updated home page and logo on November 3, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/preview.aspx?vv=700 |title=Hotmail, Messenger, nieuws en entertainment vind je op MSN.nl |publisher=Msn.com |date=1999-12-31 |accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref> It was originally expected to be widely available to over 100 million U.S. customers by early 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2009/nov09/11-03MSNPreview.mspx |title=Microsoft Announces New Logo and Site Design |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=2009-11-03 |accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/main/09/11/04/msn-unveils-new-look-home-page |title=MSN.com Preview |publisher=Neowin.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref> MSN rolled out the newer logo, together with a redesign of the overall website, on December 25, 2009.<ref name="msnnewlogo">{{cite web | url=http://www.istartedsomething.com/20091028/say-hello-new-msn-butterfly-logo/ | title=Say hello to the new MSN butterfly | accessdate=2009-10-31}}</ref><ref name="redesign">{{Cite news |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2355286,00.asp |title=PCMag.com: Microsoft Integrates Twitter Into MSN Redesign |accessdate=2009-11-05 | work=PC Magazine |first=Michael |last=Muchmore |date=November 4, 2009}}</ref>

In 2012, MSN announced on its blog that it would be unveiling a new version of the MSN.com [[home page]] on October 26, exclusively for [[Windows 8]], saying that the new version would be "clean, simple, and built for touch."<ref>{{cite web|last=MSN Team|title=The All New MSN for Windows 8|url=http://msnblog.msn.com/blogpost.aspx?post=64eb3e22-271b-4424-a5ce-475435a93d56|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref> Microsoft said it would be more app-like due to the speed of [[Internet Explorer 10]]. More new features included 'Flip Ahead', which allowed users to swipe from one article to the next. MSN for Windows 8 also had new deals with the [[Associated Press|AP]] and [[Reuters]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Albanesius|first=Chloe|title=Microsoft Overhauls MSN for Windows 8, IE10|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2410420,00.asp|publisher=PC Magazine|accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref>

====Rebranding of services====
{{main|Windows Live}}
Many of [[List of services by MSN|MSN's services]] were reorganized in 2005 and 2006 under a new brand name that Microsoft championed at the time, Windows Live. This move was part of Microsoft's strategy to improve its online offerings using the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] brand name. The company also overhauled its online [[software]] and services due to increasing competition from rivals such as Yahoo! and [[Google]]. The new name was introduced one service at a time. The group of Windows Live services used [[Web 2.0]] technology to offer features and functionality through a web browser that were traditionally only available through dedicated software programs.

Some of the MSN services affected by the rebranding included [[MSN Hotmail]], which became [[Windows Live Hotmail]] (now [[Outlook.com]]); [[MSN Messenger]], which became [[Windows Live Messenger]] (now integrated into [[Skype]]); [[MSN Search]], which became [[Live Search]] (now known as [[Bing]]); [[MSN Virtual Earth]], which became [[Live Search Maps]] (now [[Bing Maps]]); [[MSN Spaces]], which became [[Windows Live Spaces]]; [[MSN Alerts]], which became [[Windows Live Alerts]]; and [[MSN Groups]], which became [[Windows Live Groups]]. Some other services, such as [[MSN Direct]], remained a part of the MSN family without transitioning to Windows Live.

Following the launch of Windows Live, the MSN brand took on a different focus. MSN became primarily an online content provider of news, entertainment, and common interest topics through its web portal, MSN.com, while Windows Live provided most of Microsoft's online software and services. In 2012, Microsoft began to phase out the Windows Live brand, referring to each service separately by its individual brand name without any 'Windows' prefix or association.<ref name="windowslivedone">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/05/02/cloud-services-for-windows-8-and-windows-phone-windows-live-reimagined.aspx |title=Cloud services for Windows 8 and Windows Phone: Windows Live, reimagined |publisher=[[MSDN]] |date=2012-05-02 |accessdate=2014-07-21}}</ref>

==== Newest redesign ====
Microsoft launched a completely rewritten and redesigned MSN website, making use of the company's [[Metro (design language)|modern design language]], on September 30, 2014.<ref name="msn2014relaunch" />  The new MSN portal features a new version of the logo that follows a style similar to other current Microsoft products. The website no longer offers original content, instead employing editors to repurpose existing content from partners at popular and trusted organizations. Much of the existing content on MSN was eliminated as the website was simplified into a new [[home page]] and categories, most of which have [[MSN#Current suite of apps|corresponding apps]]:<ref>{{cite news|last=Whitney|first=Lance|title=Microsoft unveils MSN makeover, rebranded apps|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-unveils-msn-makeover-rebranded-apps/|newspaper=CNET|date=30 September 2014}}</ref>

The top of the home page provides access to Microsoft services [[Bing]], [[Outlook.com]], [[Skype]], [[Office Online]], [[OneNote]], [[OneDrive]], [[Bing Maps]], and [[Groove Music]], as well as popular [[social media]] services [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].<ref name="msn2014relaunch" /> Signing into MSN with a [[Microsoft account]] allows for personalized content to appear and to be synchronized across devices on the website and in the [[MSN#Current suite of apps|corresponding apps]]. The redesign of the website led to the closure of MSN's longtime personalized home page service 'My MSN', which was made up of customized [[RSS feeds]], as the new website no longer supports user-specified RSS content. However, it added some customizability, allowing each category on the home page to be reordered or hidden.

With the 2014 relaunch, MSN now supports [[responsive design]] and eliminates the need for a separate [[mobile website]]. The redesign of MSN proved positive and helped increase traffic with an additional 10 million daily visitors after two months.<ref name=WindowsOnBeta>{{cite news|last=Finney|first=Joseph|title=How has Microsoft's redesign of MSN.com affected daily site traffic?|url=http://www.winbeta.org/news/how-has-microsofts-redesign-msncom-affected-daily-site-traffic|newspaper=WinBeta|date=19 November 2014}}</ref>

Along with the 2014 redesign of the MSN web portal, Microsoft relaunched many of the [[Bing]] apps that originally shipped with [[Windows 8|Windows]] and [[Windows Phone]] as a suite of MSN apps. In December 2014, the new apps became available across all the other major [[mobile device]] platforms as well: [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[Fire OS]].<ref name=WinBetamsnapps>{{cite news|last=Saleem|first=Hammad|title=The MSN suite of apps formerly known as Bing come to iOS and Android|url=http://www.winbeta.org/news/msn-suite-apps-formerly-known-bing-come-ios-and-android|newspaper=WinBeta|date=11 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/11/microsoft-everywhere/ |title=Microsoft everywhere: MSN apps head to iOS and Android, company buys app service |last=Gilbert |first=Ben |date=December 11, 2014 |publisher=Engadget |accessdate=December 15, 2014}}</ref><ref name=msnappsdroidlife>{{cite news|last=O'tato|first=Tim|title=Microsoft Launches Suite of MSN Apps to Google Play, Includes Weather and Sports|url=http://www.droid-life.com/2014/12/11/microsoft-launches-suite-of-msn-apps-to-google-play-includes-weather-and-sports/|newspaper=Droid-Life|date=11 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=AndroidAndMe>{{cite news|last=Selleck|first=Evan|title=Microsoft Launches M.S.N. applications for Google Android devices|url=http://androidandme.com/2014/12/news/microsoft-launches-msn-apps-for-android/|newspaper=Android & Me|date=11 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=msnappsAndroidCentral>{{cite news|last=Edmonds|first=Rich|title=Microsoft's MSN suite of apps are now available on Android|url=http://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-launches-suite-msn-apps-android|newspaper=Android Central|date=11 December 2014}}</ref>

There are currently four apps in the suite: MSN News, MSN Weather, MSN Sports, and MSN Money.<ref name=cnetrebrandapps>{{cite news|last=Trenholm|first=Rich|title=Microsoft rebrands Bing apps under revamped MSN, coming soon to Android and iOS|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-rebrands-bing-apps-under-revamped-msn-coming-soon-to-android-and-ios/|newspaper=CNet|date=8 September 2014}}</ref> Each app brings a unified experience with the MSN website and synchronizes preferences across devices; for example, setting a list of [[stocks]] to watch on MSN.com will show the same data on the MSN Money app on all devices where the user is signed in with a [[Microsoft account]].

Before the rebranding from Bing to MSN, the News, Weather, Sports, Money, and Travel apps first shipped with [[Windows 8]], while the Health & Fitness and Food & Drink apps first appeared in [[Windows 8.1]].<ref name=WMPowerUser>{{cite news|last=Viswav|first=Pradeep|title=MSN Health and Fitness App Now Allows You To Keep Track Of Steps Taken From Lockscreen|url=http://wmpoweruser.com/msn-health-and-fitness-app-now-allows-you-to-keep-track-of-steps-taken-from-lockscreen/|newspaper=Windows Mobile PowerUser|date=12 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=PhoneArena1>{{cite news|last=T.|first=Nick|title=Bing Food & Drink to debut in Windows 8.1, foodies take note|url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/Bing-Food---Drink-to-debut-in-Windows-8.1-foodies-take-note_id44546|newspaper=Phone Arena|date=26 June 2014}}</ref>

After its acquisition of [[Microsoft Mobile|Nokia's mobile phone division]], Microsoft also started bundling MSN services with its [[Series 30+|Nokia-branded feature phones]], though currently the only supported model is the [[Nokia 215]].<ref name=GSMArena>{{cite news|last=Rawat|first=Sam|title=Microsoft unveils Nokia 215 and 215 Dual SIM|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/microsoft_unveils_nokia_215_and_215_dual_sim-news-10645.php|newspaper=G.S.M.

In July 2015, Microsoft announced the planned discontinuation of the Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, and Travel apps on all platforms, and that they will not be bundled with [[Windows 10]].<ref name=pcw-appsdiscontinued>{{cite web|title=Microsoft killing Photosynth and MSN apps, including Health & Fitness, Food & Drink|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2946842/microsoft-killing-photosynth-and-msn-apps-including-health-and-fitness-food-and-drink.html|website=PC World|accessdate=19 July 2015}}</ref> The three apps have been discontinued; however, the other four apps are still available.

====MSN News====

<!-- Bing News is different from MSN News and Bing News the app, respectively -->
The MSN News app (previously ''Bing News'') is a [[news aggregator]] and service that features the latest news headlines and articles hand-picked by editors around the clock from trusted sources across the web. The app includes sections for top stories, U.S., world, [[politics]], money, technology, entertainment, opinion, sports, 'weekend reads', crime, and offbeat news. It allows users to set their own favorite topics, receive notifications of breaking news though alerts, filter preferred news sources, and alter font sizes to make articles easier to read.<ref name=WindowsCentral>{{cite news|last=Rubino|first=Daniël|title=Microsoft announces Bing Apps for Windows Phone 8, bringing News, Weather, Sports and Finance to the small screen [Updated]|url=http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-announces-bing-apps-windows-phone-8|newspaper=Windows Central|date=7 August 2013}}</ref>

=== Previous apps ===
Microsoft first offered content from its MSN web portal on [[mobile devices]] in the early 2000s through a service it called ''Pocket MSN'' (in line with its [[Pocket PC]] products of the era) and later renamed 'MSN Mobile'. The original MSN Mobile software was preloaded on many [[PDAs]] and [[cell phones]] and usually provided access to legacy MSN services like [[Hotmail|email]], [[MSN Messenger|instant messaging]], [[MSN Spaces|blogs]], and [[Bing|web search]]. Some [[wireless carrier]]s charged a premium to access it. As many former MSN properties were spun off to [[Windows Live]], [[Bing]], and other successors in late 2000s, the [[Microsoft Mobile Services]] division took over the development of mobile apps related to those services.

In the meantime, Microsoft's MSN mobile apps took on a more content-related focus along with the web portal itself. Previous versions of MSN apps that were bundled with [[Windows Mobile]] and early versions of [[Windows Phone]],<ref name=Softpedia>{{cite news|last=Arghire|first=Ionut|title=Windows Phone 7 Confirmed with Messenger and MSN Apps|url=http://archive.news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-Phone-7-Confirmed-with-Messenger-and-MSN-Apps-158812.shtml|newspaper=[[Softpedia]]|date=30 September 2010}}</ref> as well as MSN apps for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and the [[iPad]] in the early 2010s, were primarily repositories for news articles found on MSN.com.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsphone.com/en-GB/apps/250af76d-2444-e011-854c-00237de2db9e|title=MSN for Windows Phone|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=|accessdate=2012-03-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/msn-for-ipad/id497011996?mt=8|title=MSN for iPad|publisher=[[Apple Inc]]|date=|accessdate=2012-03-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=msn.android&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm1zbi5hbmRyb2lkIl0.|title=MSN for Android|publisher=[[Google]]|date=|accessdate=2012-03-11}}</ref> Other earlier MSN mobile apps included versions of MSN Weather and MSN Money for [[Windows Mobile 6.5]],<ref name=iStartedSomething1>{{cite news|last=Zheng|first=Long|title=Widgets: Windows Mobile 6.5 joins the "web applications" bandwagon|url=http://www.istartedsomething.com/20090310/widgets-windows-mobile-65-joins-the-web-applications-bandwagon/|newspaper=iStartedSomething|date=10 March 2009}}</ref><ref name=PocketsNow1>{{cite news|last=Webster|first=Daniel|title=Marketplace Pick: MSN Weather Widget|url=http://pocketnow.com/software-1/marketplace-pick-msn-weather-widget|newspaper=PocketNow|date=12 February 2010}}</ref><ref name=WMPowerUser2>{{cite news|last=Surur|first=Suril|title=Windows Mobile 6.5 gets Widget Engine|url=http://wmpoweruser.com/windows-mobile-65-gets-widget-engine/|newspaper=Windows Mobile PowerUser|date=28 October 2010}}</ref> and 'MSN Money Stocks' and a [[men's magazine]] called 'MSN OnIt' for [[Windows Phone 7]].<ref name=247PressRelease>{{cite news|last=Ritchie|first=Jennifer|title=Cypress Creates New MSN Money Stocks Application for Microsoft Windows Phone 7|url=http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/cypress-creates-new-msn-money-stocks-application-for-microsoft-windows-phone-7-180270.php|newspaper=24-7 Press Release|date=10 November 2010}}</ref><ref name=WMPowerUser3>{{cite news|last=Surur|first=Suril|title=MSN Onit for (US) men only (video)|url=http://wmpoweruser.com/msn-onit-for-us-men-only-video/|newspaper=Windows Mobile PowerUser|date=11 April 2011}}</ref>

====MSN Health & Fitness====

==International==
Microsoft's world headquarters is in the [[United States]], so the main MSN website is based there. However, MSN has offered various international versions of its portal since its inception in 1995 for dozens of countries around the world.<ref name="msnworldwide"/> A list of international MSN affiliates is available at MSN Worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/msn-worldwide|title=MSN Worldwide|publisher=}}</ref>

Following the redesign and relaunch of the MSN web portal in 2014, most international MSN websites share the same layout as the U.S. website and are largely indistinguishable from it, aside from their content. There are at least two exceptions: [[ninemsn]], a longtime partnership between Microsoft and the [[Nine Network]] in [[Australia]] that now coexists alongside a standard MSN website for Australia; and [[MSN China]], an entirely customized version of MSN for [[China]].
