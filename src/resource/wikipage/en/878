An '''abugida''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|b|uː|ˈ|ɡ|iː|d|ə}} (from [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] አቡጊዳ ''’äbugida''), and likewise an '''alphasyllabary''', is a [[Writing systems#Segmental writing system|segmental writing system]] in which consonant–vowel sequences are written as a unit: each unit is based on a [[consonant]] letter, and [[vowel]] notation is secondary. This contrasts with a full [[alphabet]], in which vowels have status equal to consonants, and with an [[abjad]], in which vowel marking is absent or optional. (In less formal contexts, all three types of script may be termed alphabets.) The terms also contrast them with a [[syllabary]], in which the symbols cannot be split into separate consonants and vowels.  Abugidas include the extensive [[Brahmic family of scripts]] of South and Southeast Asia.

As is the case for syllabaries, the units of the writing system may consist of the representations both of syllables and of consonants.  For scripts of the Brahmic family, the term ''[[Shiksha#syllable|akshara]]'' is used for the units.

''Abugida'' as a term in linguistics was proposed by [[Peter T. Daniels]] in his 1990 [[Linguistic typology|typology]] of [[writing system]]s.<ref>{{citation|jstor=602899|title=Fundamentals of Grammatology|author=Peter T. Daniels|date=Oct–Dec 1990|volume=119|issue=4|pages=727–731 |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic129948.files/Daniels.pdf}}</ref> ''’Abugida'' is an Ethiopian name for the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge‘ez script]], taken from four letters of that script, ''{{'}}ä bu gi da'', in much the same way that ''[[abecedary]]'' is derived from Latin ''a be ce de'', and ''[[alphabet]]'' is derived from the names of the two first letters in the [[Greek alphabet]], ''alpha'' and ''beta''. As Daniels used the word, an abugida is in contrast with a [[syllabary]], where letters with shared consonants or vowels show no particular resemblance to one another, and also with an [[alphabet]] proper, where independent letters are used to denote both consonants and vowels. The term ''alphasyllabary'' was suggested for the Indic scripts in 1997 by [[William Bright]], following South Asian linguistic usage, to convey the idea that "they share features of both alphabet and syllabary."<ref>He describes this term as "formal", i.e., more concerned with graphic arrangement of symbols, whereas ''abugida'' was "functional", putting the focus on sound–symbol correspondence. However, this is not a distinction made in the literature.</ref><ref name=Bright/>

Abugidas were long considered to be syllabaries, or intermediate between syllabaries and alphabets, and the term ''syllabics'' is retained in the name of [[Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]]. Other terms that have been used include ''neosyllabary'' ([[James-Germain Février|Février]] 1959), ''pseudo-alphabet'' ([[Fred Householder|Householder]] 1959), ''semisyllabary'' ([[David Diringer|Diringer]] 1968; a word that has [[semi-syllabary|other uses]]) and ''syllabic alphabet'' ([[Florian Coulmas|Coulmas]] 1996; this term is also a synonym for [[syllabary]]).<ref name=Bright/>

The formal definitions given by Daniels and Bright for abugida and alphasyllabary differ; some writing systems are abugidas but not alphasyllabaries, and some are alphasyllabaries but not abugidas.

==General Description==
The formal definitions given by Daniels and Bright for abugida and alphasyllabary differ; some writing systems are abugidas but not alphasyllabaries, and some are alphasyllabaries but not abugidas.  An abugida is defined as "a type of writing system whose basic characters denotes consonants followed by a particular vowel, and in which diacritics denote other vowels".<ref name=WWS_glossary/>  (This 'particular vowel' is referred to as the ''inherent'' or ''implicit'' vowel, as opposed to the ''explicit'' vowels marked by the 'diacritics'.)  An alphasyllabary is defined as "a type of writing system in which the vowels are denoted by subsidiary symbols not all of which occur in a linear order (with relation to the consonant symbols) that is congruent with their temporal order in speech".<ref name=WWS_glossary/>  Bright did not require that an alphabet explicitly represent all vowels.<ref name=Bright/>  [[#Phagspa|Phagspa]] is an example of an abugida that is not an alphasyllabary, and modern [[Lao alphabet|Lao]] is an example of an alphasyllabary that is not an abugida, for its vowels are always explicit.

This description is expressed in terms of an abugida.  Formally, an alphasyllabary that is not an abugida can be converted to an abugida by adding a purely formal vowel sound that is never used and declaring that to be the inherent vowel of the letters representing consonants.  This may formally make the system ambiguous, but in 'practice' this is not a problem, for then the interpretation with the never used inherent vowel sound will always be a wrong interpretation!  Note that the actual pronunciation may be complicated by interactions between the sounds apparently written just as the sounds of the letters in the English words ''wan, gem'' and ''war'' are affected by neighbouring letters.

The fundamental principles of an abugida apply to words made up of consonant-vowel (CV) syllables.  The syllables are written as a linear sequences of the units of the script.  Each syllable is either a letter that represents the sound of a consonant and the inherent vowel, or a letter with a modification to indicate the vowel, either by means of [[diacritic]]s, or by changes in the form of the letter itself.  If all modifications are by diacritics and all diacritics follow the direction of the writing of the letters, then the abugida is not an alphasyllabary.

However, most languages have words that are more complicated than a sequence of CV syllables, even ignoring tone.

The first complication is syllables that consist of just a vowel (V).  Now, in some languages, this issue does not arise, for every syllable starts with a consonant.  This is common in Semitic languages and in languages of mainland SE Asia, and for such languages this issue need not arise.  For some languages, a [[zero consonant]] letter is used as though every syllable began with a consonant.  For other languages, each vowel has a separate letter that is used for each syllable consisting of just the vowel.  These letters are known as ''independent vowels'', and are found in most Indic scripts.  These letters may be quite different to the corresponding diacritics, which by contrast are known as ''dependent vowels''.  As a result of the spread of writing systems, independent vowels may be used to represent syllables beginning with a glottal stop, even for non-initial syllables.

The next two complications are sequences of consonants before a vowel (CCV) and syllables ending in a consonant (CVC). The simplest solution, which is not always available, is to break with the principle of writing words as a sequence of syllables and use a unit representing just a consonant (C).  This unit may be represented with:
*a modification that explicitly indicates the lack of a vowel ([[virama]]),
*a lack of vowel marking (often with ambiguity between no vowel and a default [[inherent vowel]]),
*vowel marking for a short or neutral vowel such as ''[[schwa]]'' (with ambiguity between no vowel and that short or neutral vowel), or
*a visually unrelated letter.

In a true abugida, the lack of distinctive marking may result from the diachronic loss of the inherent vowel, e.g. by [[syncope (phonology)|syncope]] and [[apocope]] [[Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages|in Hindi]].

When not handled by decomposition into C + CV, CCV syllables are handled by combining the two consonants.  In the Indic scripts, the earliest method was simply to arrange them vertically, but the two consonants may merge as a [[Typographic ligature|conjunct consonant]] letters, where two or more letters are graphically joined in a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]], or otherwise change their shapes.  Rarely, one of the consonants may be replaced by a gemination mark, e.g. the [[Gurmukhi]] ''[[Gurmukhi alphabet#Gemination: addak|addak]]''.  When they are arranged vertically, as in [[Burmese alphabet|Burmese]] or [[Khmer alphabet|Khmer]], they are said to be 'stacked'.  Often there has been a change to writing the two consonants side by side.  In the latter case, the fact of combination may be indicated by a diacritic on one of the consonants or a change in the form of one of the consonants, e.g. the [[Devanagari#Conjuncts|half forms]] of Devanagari.  Generally, the reading order is top to bottom or the general reading order of the script, but sometimes the order is reversed.

The division of a word into syllables for the purposes of writing does not always accord with the natural phonetics of the language.  For example, Brahmic scripts commonly handle a phonetic sequence CVC-CV as CV-CCV or CV-C-CV.  However, sometimes phonetic CVC syllables are handled as single units, and the final consonant may be represented:

*in much the same way as the second consonant in CCV, e.g. in the [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]]{{citation needed|reason=This is the condensed, single-stack style, not the usual multi-stack style|date=January 2016}}, [[Khmer alphabet|Khmer]]<ref name="TUS_Khmer_VC"/> and [[Tai Tham alphabet|Tai Tham]]<ref  name=Tai_Tham_Unicode_Proposal/> scripts. <!-- Full stop is **after** reference because the final reference refers only to Tai Tham. The list of names has now been sandwiched by 'the ... scripts' to prevent the reference for Tai Tham being taken to apply to the whole sentence. -->  The positioning of the components may be slightly different, as in Khmer and Tai Tham.
*by a special dependent consonant sign, which may be a smaller or differently placed version of the full consonant letter, or may be a distinct sign altogether.
*not at all.  For example, repeated consonants need not be represented, homorganic nasals may be ignored, and in [[Philippine scripts]], the syllable-final consonant was traditionally never represented.<ref name=WWS_Insular_SEA/><!-- p476 -->

More complicated unit structures (e.g. CC or CCVC) are handled by combining the various techniques above.

==Family-Specific Features==
There are three principal families of abugidas, depending on whether vowels are indicated by modifying consonants by ''diacritics, distortion,'' or ''orientation.''<ref>John D. Berry (2002:19) ''Language Culture Type''</ref>
*The oldest and largest is the [[Brahmic family]] of India and Southeast Asia, in which vowels are marked with [[diacritic]]s and syllable-final consonants, when they occur, are indicated with [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], diacritics, or with a special [[virama|vowel-canceling mark]].
*In the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ethiopic family]], vowels are marked by modifying the shapes of the consonants, and one of the vowel-forms serves additionally to indicate final consonants.
*In the [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Cree family]], vowels are marked by rotating or flipping the consonants, and final consonants are indicated with either special diacritics or superscript forms of the main initial consonants.

[[Tāna]] of the [[Maldives]] has dependent vowels and a zero vowel sign, but no inherent vowel.

===Indic (Brahmic)===
{{see also|Brahmic family of scripts}}
Indic scripts originated in [[India]] and spread to [[Southeast Asia]]. All surviving Indic scripts are descendants of the [[Brahmi alphabet]]. Today they are used in most languages of [[South Asia]] (although replaced by [[Perso-Arabic]] in [[Urdu]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] and some other languages of [[Pakistan]] and [[India]]), mainland [[Southeast Asia]] ([[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]]; but not [[Malaysia]] or [[Vietnam]]), and [[Indonesia]]n archipelago ([[Javanese script|Javanese]], [[Balinese script|Balinese]], [[Sundanese script|Sundanese]], etc.). The primary division is into North Indic scripts used in Northern India, Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan, and Southern Indic scripts used in [[South India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Southeast Asia]].
South Indic letter forms are very rounded; North Indic less so, though [[Odia script|Odia]], Golmol and Litumol of Nepal script are rounded.

Most North Indic scripts' full letters incorporate a horizontal line at the top, with [[Gujarati script|Gujarati]] and Odia as exceptions; South Indic scripts do not.

Indic scripts indicate vowels through dependent vowel signs (diacritics) around the consonants, often including a sign that explicitly indicates the lack of a vowel. If a consonant has no vowel sign, this indicates a default vowel. Vowel diacritics may appear above, below, to the left, to the right, or around the consonant.

The most widely used Indic script is [[Devanagari]], shared by [[Hindi]], [[Bhojpuri]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], and often [[Sanskrit]]. A basic letter such as [[Devanagari ka|क]] in Hindi represents a syllable with the default vowel, in this case ''ka'' ({{IPA|[kə]}}). In some languages, including Hindi, it becomes a final closing consonant at the end of a word, in this case ''k''. The inherent vowel may be changed by adding vowel mark ([[diacritic]]s), producing syllables such as कि ''ki,'' कु ''ku,'' के ''ke,''  को ''ko.''

|}

In many of the Brahmic scripts, a syllable beginning with a cluster is treated as a single character for purposes of vowel marking, so a vowel marker like {{Unicode|ि}} ''-i,'' falling before the character it modifies, may appear several positions before the place where it is pronounced. For example, the game [[cricket]] in [[Hindi]] is क्रिकेट ''krikeţ;'' the diacritic for {{IPA|/i/}} appears before the [[consonant cluster]] {{IPA|/kr/}}, not before the {{IPA|/r/}}. A more unusual example is seen in the [[Batak alphabet]]: Here the syllable ''bim'' is written ''ba-ma-i-(virama)''. That is, the vowel diacritic and virama are both written after the consonants for the whole syllable.

In many abugidas, there is also a diacritic to suppress the inherent vowel, yielding the bare consonant. In [[Devanagari]], क् is ''k,'' and ल् is ''l''. This is called the ''[[virāma]]'' or ''halantam'' in [[Sanskrit]]. It may be used to form [[consonant cluster]]s, or to indicate that a consonant occurs at the end of a word. Thus in Sanskrit, a default vowel consonant such as क does not take on a final consonant sound. Instead, it keeps its vowel. For writing two consonants without a vowel in between, instead of using diacritics on the first consonant to remove its vowel, another popular method of special [[conjunct]] forms is used in which two or more consonant characters are merged to express a cluster, such as Devanagari: क्ल ''kla.'' (Note that some fonts display this as क् followed by ल, rather than forming a conjunct. This expedient is used by [[ISCII]] and South Asian scripts of [[Unicode]].) Thus a closed syllable such as ''kal'' requires two ''aksharas'' to write.

The [[Róng]] script used for the [[Lepcha language]] goes further than other Indic abugidas, in that a single ''akshara'' can represent a closed syllable: Not only the vowel, but any final consonant is indicated by a diacritic. For example, the syllable [sok] would be written as something like {{unicode|s̥̽}}, here with an underring representing {{IPA|/o/}} and an overcross representing the diacritic for final {{IPA|/k/}}. Most other Indic abugidas can only indicate a very limited set of final consonants with diacritics, such as {{IPA|/ŋ/}} or {{IPA|/r/}}, if they can indicate any at all.

===Ethiopic===
[[Image:Ethiopic genesis.jpg|thumb|The [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez script]], an abugida of Eritrea and Ethiopia]]
In [[Ethiopic script|Ethiopic]], where the term ''abugida'' originates, the diacritics have been fused to the consonants to the point that they must be considered modifications of the form of the letters. Children learn each modification separately, as in a syllabary; nonetheless, the graphic similarities between syllables with the same consonant is readily apparent, unlike the case in a true syllabary.

Though now an abugida, the [[Ge'ez alphabet]], until the advent of Christianity (''ca.'' AD 350), had originally been what would now be termed an ''[[abjad]]''. In the Ge'ez abugida (or ''fidel''), the base form of the letter (also known as ''fidel'') may be altered. For example, ሀ ''hä'' {{IPA|[hə]}} (base form), ሁ ''hu'' (with a right-side diacritic that doesn't alter the letter), ሂ ''hi'' (with a subdiacritic that compresses the consonant, so it is the same height), ህ ''hə'' {{IPA|[hɨ]}} or {{IPA|[h]}} (where the letter is modified with a kink in the left arm).

===Canadian Aboriginal syllabics===
<!--[[Image:Lci.gif]] an inscription of [[Old Kawi]] found in the [[Philippines]]-->

In the family known as [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], which was inspired by the [[Devanagari script]] of India, vowels are indicated by changing the orientation of the [[syllabogram]]. Each vowel has a consistent orientation; for example, [[Inuktitut]] ᐱ ''pi,'' ᐳ ''pu,'' ᐸ ''pa;'' ᑎ ''ti,'' ᑐ ''tu,'' ᑕ ''ta''. Although there is a vowel inherent in each, all rotations have equal status and none can be identified as basic. Bare consonants are indicated either by separate diacritics, or by superscript versions of the ''aksharas''; there is no vowel-killer mark.

==Borderline cases==

===Vowelled abjads===
Consonantal scripts ("[[abjad]]s") are normally written without indication of many vowels. However, in some contexts like teaching materials or [[scripture]]s, [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]] are written with full indication of vowels via diacritic marks (''[[harakat]]'', ''[[niqqud]]'') making them effectively alphasyllabaries. The Brahmic and Ethiopic families are thought to have originated from the Semitic abjads by the addition of vowel marks.

<!-- Not best place to mention Thaana since not an abjad
[[Thaana]] is similar, with all vowels marked with diacritics, and no inherent vowel. However, the absence of a vowel is also marked with a diacritic, as in many Indic abugidas. Thaana developed among a population that was already literate in an Indic abugida.
-->
The Arabic scripts used for [[Sorani Kurdish|Kurdish]] in Iraq and for [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] in [[Xinjiang]], [[China]], as well as the Hebrew script of [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], are fully vowelled, but because the vowels are written with full letters rather than diacritics (with the exception of distinguishing between /a/ and /o/ in the latter) and there are no inherent vowels, these are considered alphabets, not abugidas.

===Phagspa===
The imperial Mongol script called [['Phags-pa script|Phagspa]] was derived from the Tibetan abugida, but all vowels are written in-line rather than as diacritics. However, it retains the features of having an inherent vowel /a/ and having distinct initial vowel letters.

===Pahawh===
[[Pahawh Hmong]] is a non-segmental script that indicates [[syllable onset]]s and [[syllable rime|rime]]s, such as consonant clusters and vowels with final consonants. Thus it is not segmental and cannot be considered an abugida. However, it superficially resembles an abugida with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed. Most syllables are written with two letters in the order rime–onset (typically vowel-consonant), even though they are pronounced as onset-rime (consonant-vowel), rather like the position of the {{IPA|/i/}} vowel in Devanagari, which is written before the consonant. Pahawh is also unusual in that, while an inherent rime {{IPA|/āu/}} (with mid tone) is unwritten, it also has an inherent onset {{IPA|/k/}}. For the syllable {{IPA|/kau/}}, which requires one or the other of the inherent sounds to be overt, it is {{IPA|/au/}} that is written. Thus it is the rime (vowel) that is basic to the system.

===Meroitic===
It is difficult to draw a dividing line between abugidas and other [[segment (linguistics)|segmental]] scripts. For example, the [[Meroitic script]] of ancient [[Sudan]] did not indicate an inherent ''a'' (one symbol stood for both ''m'' and ''ma,'' for example), and is thus similar to Brahmic family of abugidas. However, the other vowels were indicated with full letters, not diacritics or modification, so the system was essentially an alphabet that did not bother to write the most common vowel.

===Shorthand===
Several systems of [[shorthand]] use diacritics for vowels, but they do not have an inherent vowel, and are thus more similar to [[Thaana]] and [[Kurdish alphabet|Kurdish script]] than to the Brahmic scripts. The [[Gabelsberger shorthand]] system and its derivatives modify the ''following'' consonant to represent vowels. The [[Pollard script]], which was based on shorthand, also uses diacritics for vowels; the placements of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. [[Pitman shorthand]] uses straight strokes and quarter-circle marks in different orientations as the principal "alphabet" of consonants; vowels are shown as light and heavy dots, dashes and other marks in one of 3 possible positions to indicate the various vowel-sounds. However, to increase writing speed, Pitman has rules for [http://pitmanshorthand.homestead.com "vowel indication"] using the positioning or choice of consonant signs so that writing vowel-marks can be dispensed with.

==Development==
As the term ''alphasyllabary'' suggests, abugidas have been considered an intermediate step between [[alphabet]]s and [[syllabary|syllabaries]]. Historically, abugidas appear to have evolved from [[abjad]]s (vowelless alphabets). They contrast with syllabaries, where there is a distinct symbol for each syllable or consonant-vowel combination, and where these have no systematic similarity to each other, and typically develop directly from [[logogram|logographic scripts]]. Compare the Devanagari examples above to sets of syllables in the Japanese [[hiragana]] syllabary: か ''ka'', き ''ki'', く ''ku'', け ''ke'', こ ''ko'' have nothing in common to indicate ''k;'' while ら ''ra'', り ''ri'', る ''ru'', れ ''re'', ろ ''ro'' have neither anything in common for ''r'', nor anything to indicate that they have the same vowels as the ''k'' set.

Most Indian and Indochinese abugidas appear to have first been developed from abjads with the {{Unicode|[[Kharoṣṭhī]]}} and [[Brāhmī script]]s; the abjad in question is usually considered to be the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] one, but while the link between Aramaic and Kharosthi is more or less undisputed, this is not the case with Brahmi. The Kharosthi family does not survive today, but Brahmi's descendants include most of the modern scripts of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Ge'ez derived from a different abjad, the [[Sabaean language#Script|Sabean script]] of [[Yemen]]; the advent of vowels coincided with the introduction of Christianity about AD 350.<ref name=WWS_Ethiopic/>
