It is bordered by [[Pakistan]] in the south and east; [[Iran]] in the west; [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Tajikistan]] in the north; and [[China]] in the far northeast. Its territory covers {{convert|652,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, making it the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|41st largest]] country in the world.

Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] Era, and the country's [[Geostrategy|strategic]] location along the [[Silk Road]] connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia. Through the ages the land has been home to various peoples and witnessed numerous military campaigns, notably by [[Alexander the Great]], [[Maurya Empire|Mauryas]], [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Muslim Arabs]], [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|Mongols]], [[First Anglo-Afghan War|British]], [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet]], and in the modern-era by [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Western powers]]. The land also served as the source from which the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalites]], [[Samanid Empire|Samanids]], [[Saffarid Empire|Saffarids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghorids]], [[Khilji dynasty|Khiljis]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], [[Hotak Empire|Hotaks]], [[Durrani dynasty|Durranis]], and others have risen to form major empires.<ref name="Galvin-PreIslamic">{{cite web |url=http://www.gl.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/PreIslamic.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011103002246/http://www.gl.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/PreIslamic.html |archivedate=3 November 2001|title=The Pre-Islamic Period |publisher=Illinois Institute of Technology |work=Afghanistan Country Study |first=Luke |last=Griffin |date=14 January 2002 |accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref>

The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century.  In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a [[buffer state]] in the "[[The Great Game|Great Game]]" between [[British Raj|British India]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. Following the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1919, [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah]] unsuccessfully attempted to modernize the country. It remained peaceful during [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]]'s forty years of monarchy. A series of coups in the 1970s was followed by a [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|series of civil wars]] that devastated much of Afghanistan and continues to this day.

== Etymology ==
{{Main article|Name of Afghanistan}}
The name ''Afghānistān'' ([[Pashto]] |افغانستان) is believed to be as old as the [[ethnonym]] [[Afghan (ethnonym)|''Afghan'']], which is documented in the 10th-century [[geography]] book ''[[Hudud ul-'alam]]''. The [[root (linguistics)|root]] name "[[Afghan]]" was used [[history|historically]] in reference to a member of the ethnic [[Pashtuns]], and the [[suffix]] "[[-stan]]" means "place of" in [[Persian Language|Persian]]. Therefore, Afghanistan translates to ''land of the Afghans'' or, more specifically in a historical sense, to ''land of the Pashtuns''. However, the modern [[Constitution of Afghanistan]] states that "[t]he word Afghan shall apply to every [[Demographics of Afghanistan|citizen of Afghanistan]]."<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution of Afghanistan|url=http://www.embassyofafghanistan.org/page/constitution |year=2004 |accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>

{{History of Afghanistan}}
[[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavations]] of prehistoric sites by [[Louis Dupree (professor)|Louis Dupree]] and others suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world. An important site of early historical activities, many believe that Afghanistan compares to [[Egypt]] in terms of the historical value of its archaeological sites.<ref name="JFS">{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761569370___42/Afghanistan.html |title=Afghanistan&nbsp;– John Ford Shroder, University of Nebraska |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=19 May 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwDUj6WJ?url=http%3A%2F%2Fencarta.msn.com%2Ftext_761569370___42%2FAfghanistan.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1881896-1,00.html |title=Afghanistan: A Treasure Trove for Archaeologists |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |date=26 February 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726153721/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1881896-1,00.html |archivedate=26 July 2013 }}</ref>

The country sits at a unique nexus point where numerous civilizations have interacted and often fought. It has been home to various peoples through the ages, among them the [[ancient Iranian peoples]] who established the dominant role of [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in the region. At multiple points, the land has been incorporated within large regional empires, among them the [[Achaemenid Empire]], the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian Empire]], the [[Maurya Empire|Indian Maurya Empire]], and the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Islamic Empire]].<ref>The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia: Language, Material Culture and Ethnicity by George Erdosy, p.321</ref>

Many empires and kingdoms have also risen to power in Afghanistan, such as the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrians]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Hephthalites]], [[Kabul Shahi]]s, [[Saffarid Dynasty|Saffarids]], [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]], [[Khilji dynasty|Khiljis]], [[Kartids]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], and finally the [[Hotak dynasty|Hotak]] and [[Durrani dynasty|Durrani]] dynasties that marked the political origins of the modern state.<ref>The History of Afghanistan by Meredith L.

[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|left|Bilingual ([[Koine Greek|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) [[Edicts of Ashoka|edict]] by Emperor [[Ashoka]] from the 3rd century BCE discovered in the southern city of [[Kandahar]]]]
[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron age]]s have been found in Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of [[Mundigak]] (near [[Kandahar]] in the south of the country) may have been a colony of the nearby [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. More recent findings established that the Indus Valley Civilisation stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan, making the ancient civilisation today part of Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. In more detail, it extended from what today is northwest Pakistan to northwest India and northeast Afghanistan. An Indus Valley site has been found on the [[Oxus River]] at [[Shortugai]] in northern Afghanistan.<ref name="The Ancient Indus pp.1">The Ancient Indus: Urbanism, Economy, and Society. pp.1</ref><ref>Kenoyer, Jonathan Mark (1998).

After 2000 BCE, successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan; among them were many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] [[Indo-Iranians]]. These tribes later migrated further into South Asia, Western Asia, and toward Europe via the area north of the [[Caspian Sea]]. The region at the time was referred to as [[Ariana]].<ref name="JFS" /><ref>Bryant, Edwin F.

The religion [[Zoroastrianism]] is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder [[Zoroaster]] is thought to have lived and died in [[Balkh]]. Ancient [[Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian languages]] may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the [[Medes]] and incorporated [[Arachosia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]], and [[Bactria]] within its eastern boundaries. An [[Epigraphy|inscription]] on the tombstone of [[Darius I of Persia]] mentions the [[Kabulistan|Kabul Valley]] in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909000527/http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 September 2012 |title=Chronological History of Afghanistan&nbsp;– the cradle of Gandharan civilisation |publisher=Gandhara.com.au |date=15 February 1989 |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref>

[[Alexander the Great]] and his Macedonian forces arrived to Afghanistan in 330 BCE after defeating [[Darius III of Persia]] a year earlier in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the [[Seleucid Empire]] controlled the region until 305 BCE, when they gave much of it to the [[Maurya Empire]] as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans controlled the area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] until they were overthrown in about 185 BCE. Their decline began 60 years after [[Ashoka]]'s rule ended, leading to the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] reconquest by the [[Greco-Bactrians]]. Much of it soon broke away from them and became part of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. They were defeated and expelled by the [[Indo-Scythians]] in the late 2nd century BCE.<ref name="LoC-pdf" /><ref>The History of Afghanistan by Meredith L. Runion, p.44</ref>

During the first century BCE, the [[Parthian Empire]] subjugated the region, but lost it to their [[Indo-Parthian]] vassals. In the mid-to-late first century CE the vast [[Kushan Empire]], centered in Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making [[Buddhism]] flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were overthrown by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] in the 3rd century CE, though the [[Indo-Sassanids]] continued to rule at least parts of the region. They were followed by the [[Kidarite]] who, in turn, were replaced by the [[Hephthalites]]. By the 6th century CE, the successors to the Kushans and Hepthalites established a small dynasty called [[Kabul Shahi]]. Much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by Buddhist culture.<ref name="Habibi">{{cite web |url=http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/Afghan_and_Afghanistan.htm |title=Afghan and Afghanistan |work=[[Abdul Hai Habibi]]|publisher=alamahabibi.com|year=1969|accessdate=17 November 2015}}</ref>

[[Arab]] [[Muslim]]s brought Islam to [[Herat]] and [[Zaranj]] in 642&nbsp;CE and began spreading eastward; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted. The land was collectively recognized by the Arabs as al-Hind due to its cultural connection with [[Greater India]]. Before Islam was introduced, people of the region were mostly Buddhists and Zoroastrians, but there were also [[Surya]] and [[Nana (Afghan goddess)|Nana]] worshipers, [[History of the Jews in Afghanistan|Jews]], and others. The [[Zunbils]] and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in 870&nbsp;CE by the [[Saffarid Dynasty|Saffarid]] Muslims of Zaranj. Later, the [[Samanids]] extended their Islamic influence south of the Hindu Kush. It is reported that Muslims and non-Muslims still lived side by side in Kabul before the [[Ghaznavids]] rose to power in the 10th century.<ref name="Elliot-2">{{cite web |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=80201012&ct=98 |title=A.—The Hindu Kings of Kábul |work=Sir H.

By the 11th century, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] defeated the remaining Hindu rulers and effectively [[Islamized]] the wider region, with the exception of [[Kafiristan]]. Afghanistan became one of the main centers in the [[Muslim world]] during this [[Islamic Golden Age]]. The [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] was overthrown by the [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]], who expanded and advanced the already powerful Islamic empire.

In 1219&nbsp;AD, [[Genghis Khan]] and his [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army overran the region. His troops are said to have annihilated the Khorasanian cities of Herat and Balkh as well as [[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamyan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |title=Central Asian world cities |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date=29 September 2007 |accessdate=6 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723185841/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |archivedate=23 July 2013 }}</ref> The destruction caused by the Mongols forced many locals to return to an agrarian rural society.<ref>{{cite news |last=Page |first=Susan |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-02-17-afghanistan-forces_N.htm |title=Obama's war: Deploying 17,000 raises stakes in Afghanistan |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> Mongol rule continued with the [[Ilkhanate]] in the northwest while the [[Khilji dynasty]] administered the Afghan tribal areas south of the Hindu Kush until the invasion of [[Timur]], who established the [[Timurid Empire]] in 1370.

In the early 16th century, [[Babur]] arrived from [[Fergana]] and captured Kabul from the [[Arghun dynasty]]. In 1526, he invaded [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi]] in India to replace the [[Lodi dynasty]] with the [[Mughal Empire]].

In 1893, [[Mortimer Durand]] made Amir Abdur Rahman Khan sign a controversial agreement in which the ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] territories were divided by the [[Durand Line]]. This was a standard [[divide and rule]] policy of the British and would lead to strained relations, especially with the later new state of Pakistan.
[[File:Zahir Shah of Afghanistan in 1930s-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]], the last king of Afghanistan, who reigned from 1933 to 1973.]]
After the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] and the signing of the [[Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919|Treaty of Rawalpindi]] on 19 August 1919, King [[Amānullāh Khān|Amanullah Khan]] declared Afghanistan a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] and fully [[independence|independent state]]. He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community and, following a 1927–28 tour of Europe and [[Turkey]], introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 [[constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]], which made elementary education compulsory. The institution of [[slavery]] was abolished in 1923.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1976| volume = Volume 25| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Americana]]|publisher=Americana Corporation | page = 24 }}</ref>

Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional [[burqa]] for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by [[Habibullah Kalakani]]. Prince [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]], Amanullah's cousin, in turn defeated and killed Kalakani in November 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favor of a more gradual approach to modernisation but was assassinated in 1933 by [[Abdul Khaliq Hazara (assassin)|Abdul Khaliq]], a [[Hazara people|Hazara]] school student.

[[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946, Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shah's uncles, [[Shah Mahmud Khan]], became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. He was replaced in 1953 by [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud Khan sought a closer relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] and a more distant one towards Pakistan. Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in [[World War II]] nor aligned with either power bloc in the [[Cold War]]. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports, and other vital infrastructure. On per capita basis, Afghanistan received more Soviet [[development aid]] than any other country. In 1973, while King Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first [[President of Afghanistan]]. In the meantime, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] got neighboring Pakistan involved in Afghanistan. Some experts suggest that Bhutto paved the way for the April 1978 [[Saur Revolution]].<ref name="Bowersox">{{cite book

Later, after Massoud and Hekmatyar had a terrible falling-out over Massoud's opposition to terrorist tactics and methods, Massoud overthrew from Jawanan-e Musulman. He joined [[Burhanuddin Rabbani|Rabani]]'s newly created Afghan political party, [[Jamiat-e Islami|Jamiat-i-Islami]], in exile in Pakistan. |authorlink=|year=2004|publisher=GeoVision, Inc.,|location=United States|isbn=0-9747323-1-1|page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVAN9pjnRzMC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA100#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>

In April 1978, the communist [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) seized power in Afghanistan in the [[Saur Revolution]]. Within months, opponents of the communist government launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]] waged by guerrilla [[mujahideen]] against government forces countrywide. The Pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers, while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hussain |first=Rizwan |title=Pakistan And The Emergence Of Islamic Militancy In Afghanistan |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2005 |pages=108–109 |isbn=978-0-7546-4434-7}}</ref> Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA&nbsp;— the dominant [[Khalq]] and the more moderate [[Parcham]]&nbsp;— resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup.

In September 1979, [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member [[Hafizullah Amin]], who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's [[Babrak Karmal]] but inclusive of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did not expect to do most of the fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kalinovsky |first=Artemy M. |title=A Long Goodbye: The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2011 |pages=25–28 |isbn=978-0-674-05866-8}}</ref> The PDPA prohibited [[usury]], declared equality of the sexes,<ref name=autogenerated4 /> and introduced women to political life.<ref name="autogenerated4">{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0028) |title=Afghanistan |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] |accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref>

From 1989 until 1992, Najibullah's government tried to solve the ongoing civil war with economic and military aid, but without Soviet troops on the ground. Pakistan's spy agency ([[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]]), headed by [[Hamid Gul]] at the time, was interested in a trans-national Islamic revolution which would cover Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia. For this purpose Pakistan masterminded an attack on [[Jalalabad]] for the Mujahideen to establish their own government in Afghanistan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/08/legacy-pakistan-loved-loathed-hamid-gul-150817114006616.html|title=The legacy of Pakistan's loved and loathed Hamid Gul|last=Nasir|first=Abbas|date=18 August 2015|work=Al-Jazeera|quote=His commitment to jihad – to an Islamic revolution transcending national boundaries, was such that he dreamed one day the "green Islamic flag" would flutter not just over Pakistan and Afghanistan, but also over territories represented by the (former Soviet Union) Central Asian republics.

This, coupled with the internal collapse of his government, led to his ousting from power in April 1992. After the fall of Najibullah's government in 1992, the post-communist [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] was established by the [[Peshawar Accord]], a peace and power-sharing agreement under which all the Afghan parties were united in April 1992, except for the Pakistani supported [[Hezb-e Islami]] of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]. Hekmatyar started a bombardment campaign against the capital city Kabul, which marked the beginning of a [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1992–96)|new phase in the war]].<ref>Afghanistan Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments by INB, p.73</ref>

Shortly after their fall from power, the Taliban began an [[Taliban insurgency|insurgency]] to regain control of Afghanistan. Over the next decade, ISAF and [[Afghan National Army|Afghan troops]] led many offensives against the Taliban but failed to fully defeat them.

Meanwhile, the [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] was able to build some democratic structures, and the country changed its name to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Attempts were made, often with the support of foreign donor countries, to improve the country's economy, healthcare, education, transport, and agriculture.

Like many of its neighboring countries, Afghanistan has an ethnically, linguistically and religiously diverse population. According to cartographer [[Mehrdad Izady|Michael Izady]] there "is precious little correspondence between language and ethnic or group identity in Afghanistan. Connections such as tribe (e.g. Pashtuns, [[Aimaqs]]), religion (e.g. the Shia Hazaras, Sayyids, [[Qizilbash#Afghanistan|Kizilbash]]), group memory (e.g. Arabs and Monghols/Mongols) or life style (e.g. [[Farsiwan|Parsiwans]]) are far more important markers of group identity than language has ever been. Only Turkmens (totally) and Uzbeks (mostly) are to be identified with languages that they speak. This has been so since the inception of the state in AD 1747."<ref>Ethnic map of Afghanistan, http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Afghanistan_Ethnic_lg.png</ref>

Afghanistan has experienced a gradual [[urbanization]] since the late 1990s but the country remains one of the world's least urban societies. In 1999 around 79% of the country's population lived in rural areas compared to around 74% in 2014.<ref name="uis.unesco.org"/> The only city with over a million residents is its capital, Kabul.

Afghanistan is a multiethnic society, and its historical status as a crossroads has contributed significantly to its diverse ethnic makeup. The population of the country is divided into a wide variety of [[ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups. Because a systematic census has not been held in the nation in decades, exact figures about the size and composition of the various ethnic groups are unavailable.

The [[Afghan presidential election, 2004|2004 Afghan presidential election]] was relatively peaceful, in which Hamid Karzai won in the first round with 55.4% of the votes. However, the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential election]] was characterized by lack of security, low voter turnout, and widespread electoral fraud.<ref name="Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped">{{cite news |last=Cooper |first=Helene |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/world/asia/03afghan.html?_r=1&hp |title=Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2 November 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511225923/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/world/asia/03afghan.html?_r=1&hp |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}</ref> The vote, along with elections for 420 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provincial council]] seats, took place in August 2009, but remained unresolved during a lengthy period of vote counting and fraud investigation.

Two months later, under international pressure, a second round run-off vote between Karzai and remaining challenger [[Abdullah Abdullah|Abdullah]] was announced, but a few days later Abdullah announced that he would not participate in 7 November run-off because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main article|Provinces of Afghanistan|Districts of Afghanistan}}
Afghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces (''[[wilayah|wilayats]]''), with each province having its own capital and a provincial administration. The provinces are further divided into about 398 smaller provincial districts, each of which normally covers a city or a number of villages. Each district is represented by a district governor.

The [[list of current governors of Afghanistan|provincial governors]] are appointed by the [[President of Afghanistan]] and the district governors are selected by the provincial governors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/world/asia/for-afghan-officials-prospect-of-death-comes-with-territory.html|title=For Afghan Officials, Prospect of Death Comes With Territory|last=Ahmed|first=Azam|date=2012-12-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-07|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The provincial governors are representatives of the central government in Kabul and are responsible for all administrative and formal issues within their provinces. There are also provincial councils that are elected through direct and general elections for a period of four years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iec.org.af/eng/content.php?id=5&cnid=24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827204439/http://www.iec.org.af/eng/content.php?id=5&cnid=24 |archivedate=27 August 2010 |title=Explaining Elections, Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan |publisher=Iec.org.af |date=9 October 2004 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref> The functions of provincial councils are to take part in provincial development planning and to participate in the monitoring and appraisal of other provincial governance institutions.

According to article 140 of the constitution and the presidential decree on electoral law, mayors of cities should be elected through free and direct elections for a four-year term. However, due to huge election costs, mayoral and municipal elections have never been held. Instead, mayors have been appointed by the government. In the capital city of Kabul, the mayor is appointed by the President of Afghanistan.

The following is a list of all the 34 provinces in alphabetical order:

The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] is in charge of maintaining the [[foreign relations of Afghanistan]]. The state has been a member of the United Nations since 1946. It enjoys strong economic relations with a number of [[NATO]] and allied states, particularly the [[Afghanistan–United States relations|United States]], [[Afghanistan–United Kingdom relations|United Kingdom]], [[Afghanistan–Germany relations|Germany]] and [[Afghanistan–Turkey relations|Turkey]]. In 2012, the United States designated Afghanistan as a [[major non-NATO ally]] and created the [[U.S.–Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement]]. Afghanistan also has friendly diplomatic relations with neighboring [[Afghanistan–Pakistan relations|Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan–Iran relations|Iran]], [[Foreign relations of Turkmenistan#Afghanistan|Turkmenistan]], [[Foreign relations of Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]], [[Afghanistan–Tajikistan relations|Tajikistan]], and [[Afghanistan–China relations|China]], and with regional states such as [[Afghanistan–India relations|India]], [[Afghanistan–Bangladesh relations|Bangladesh]], [[Foreign relations of Nepal|Nepal]], [[Foreign relations of Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], [[Afghanistan–Russia relations|Russia]], the [[Afghanistan–United Arab Emirates relations|UAE]], Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, [[Afghanistan–Japan relations|Japan]], and [[Afghanistan–South Korea relations|South Korea]]. It continues to develop diplomatic relations with other countries around the world.

[[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] (UNAMA) was established in 2002 under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1401]] in order to help the country recover from decades of war. Today, a number of NATO member states deploy about 38,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/mounting-death-toll-afghan-troops-us-general-200602525.html|title=Mounting death toll for Afghan troops: US general|date=5 November 2014|work=Yahoo News}}</ref> Its main purpose is to [[NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan|train]] the [[Afghan National Security Forces]] (ANSF).

The [[National Directorate of Security]] (NDS) is the nation's domestic [[intelligence agency]], which operates similar to that of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) and has between 15,000 and 30,000 employees. The nation also has about 126,000 national police officers, with plans to recruit more so that the total number can reach 160,000.<ref name=Pellerindate /> The [[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) is under the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of the Interior]] and serves as a single [[law enforcement agency]] all across the country. The [[Afghan National Civil Order Police]] is the main branch of the ANP, which is divided into five Brigades, each commanded by a Brigadier General. These brigades are stationed in Kabul, [[Gardez]], [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], and [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]. Every province has an appointed provincial [[Chief of Police]] who is responsible for [[law enforcement in Afghanistan|law enforcement]] throughout the province.

The police receive most of their training from Western forces under the [[NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan]]. According to a 2009 news report, a large proportion of police officers were illiterate and accused of demanding bribes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121559123&ps=cprs |title=For U.S., Vast Challenge To Expand Afghan Forces |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=19 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234157/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121559123&ps=cprs|archivedate=30 December 2013}}</ref> Jack Kem, deputy to the commander of NATO Training Mission Afghanistan and Combined Security Transition Command Afghanistan, stated that the literacy rate in the ANP would rise to over 50% by January 2012.

All parts of Afghanistan are considered dangerous due to militant activities. Hundreds of Afghan police are [[list of Afghan security forces fatality reports in Afghanistan|killed]] in the line of duty each year. Kidnapping and robberies are also reported. The [[Afghan Border Police]] (ABP) are responsible for protecting the nation's airports and borders, especially the disputed [[Durand Line]] border, which is often used by members of criminal organizations and terrorists for their illegal activities. A report in 2011 suggested that up to 3 million people were involved in the illegal drug business in Afghanistan. Attacks on government employees may be ordered by powerful mafia groups who reside inside and outside the country. Drugs from Afghanistan are exported to neighboring countries and then to other countries.

While the nation's current account deficit is largely financed with donor money, only a small portion is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations. The [[Ministry of Finance (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Finance]] is focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. For example, government revenues increased 31% to $1.7 billion from March 2010 to March 2011.

[[File:Ariana Afghan A310-300 F-GEMO.jpg|thumb|An [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]] (AAA) [[Airbus A310]] in 2006]]
Air transport in Afghanistan is provided by the national carrier, [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]] (AAA), and by private companies such as [[Afghan Jet International]], [[East Horizon Airlines]], [[Kam Air]], [[Pamir Airways]], and [[Safi Airways]]. Airlines from a number of countries also provide flights in and out of the country. These include [[Air India]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Gulf Air]], [[Iran Aseman Airlines]], [[Pakistan International Airlines]], and [[Turkish Airlines]].

The country has four international airports: [[Hamid Karzai International Airport]] (formerly Kabul International Airport), [[Kandahar International Airport]], [[Herat International Airport]], and [[Mazar-e Sharif International Airport]]. There are also around a dozen domestic airports with flights to Kabul and other major cities.

=== Rail ===
{{Main article|Rail transport in Afghanistan}}
{{as of|2014}}, the country has only two rail links, one a 75&nbsp;km line from [[Kheyrabad, Balkh|Kheyrabad]] to the [[Afghanistan–Uzbekistan Friendship Bridge|Uzbekistan border]] and the other a 10&nbsp;km long line from [[Toraghundi]] to the Turkmenistan border. Both lines are used for freight only and there is no passenger service as of yet. There are various proposals for the construction of additional rail lines in the country.<ref>Maps, Railways of Afghanistan, http://www.andrewgrantham.co.uk/afghanistan/tag/map/</ref> In 2013, the presidents of Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan attended the groundbreaking ceremony for a 225&nbsp;km line between Turkmenistan-[[Andkhvoy]]-[[Mazar-i-Sharif]]-[[Kheyrabad, Balkh|Kheyrabad]].

Newer automobiles have recently become more widely available after the rebuilding of roads and highways. They are imported from the [[United Arab Emirates]] through Pakistan and Iran. {{as of|2012}}, vehicles more than 10 years old are banned from being imported into the country. The development of the nation's road network is a major boost for the economy due to trade with neighboring countries. Postal services in Afghanistan are provided by the publicly owned [[Afghan Post]] and private companies such as [[FedEx]], [[DHL Express|DHL]], and others.

The Afghan culture has been around for over two millennia, tracing back to at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire in 500 BCE.<ref name="LoC">{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |work= |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] on Afghanistan |date=August 2008 |accessdate=16 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408085103/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf|archivedate=8 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated5">Barbara Robson, Juliene Lipson, Farid Younos, Mariam Mehdi. {{cite web |url=http://www.cal.org/co/afghan/ahist.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105173916/http://www.cal.org/co/afghan/ahist.html |archivedate=5 January 2007 |title=The Afghans&nbsp;– Their History and Culture |publisher=[[Center for Applied Linguistics]] |location=United States |date=30 June 2002 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> It is mostly a [[nomad]]ic and [[tribal society]], with different regions of the country having their own traditions, reflecting the multi-cultural and multi-lingual character of the nation.

Afghans display pride in their culture, nation, ancestry, and above all, their religion and independence. Like other highlanders, they are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their tribe loyalty and for their readiness to use force to settle disputes.<ref name="Heathcote">Heathcote, Tony (1980, 2003) "The Afghan Wars 1839–1919", Sellmount Staplehurst.</ref> As tribal warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreigners to conquer them. Tony Heathcote considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle.<ref name="Heathcote" /> There are an estimated 60 major [[Pashtun tribes]],<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/445546/Pashtun Pashtun (people)]".

The nation has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. However, many of its historic monuments have been damaged in recent wars.<ref>G.V. Brandolini. ''Afghanistan [[cultural heritage]]''. Orizzonte terra, [[Bergamo]]. 2007. p. 64.</ref> The two famous [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as [[idolatry|idolatrous]].

{{Main article|Media of Afghanistan}}
[[File:Farhad Darya's Peace Concert in 2010-cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Farhad Darya]] performing at the [[Serena Hotel]] in Kabul.]]
The Afghan mass media began in the early 20th century, with the first newspaper published in 1906. By the 1920s, [[Radio Kabul]] was broadcasting local radio services. [[Afghanistan National Television]] was launched in 1974 but was closed in 1996 when the media was tightly controlled by the Taliban.<ref name="dart">Dartnell, M. Y. ''Insurgency Online: Web Activism and Global Conflict.'' University of Toronto Press, 2006. ISBN 978-0-8020-8553-5.</ref> Since 2002, press restrictions have been gradually relaxed and private media diversified. [[Freedom of expression]] and the press is promoted in the 2004 constitution and censorship is banned, although [[defamation|defaming]] individuals or producing material contrary to the principles of Islam is prohibited. In 2008, [[Reporters Without Borders]] ranked the media environment as 156 out of 173 countries, with the 1st being the most free. Around 400 publications were registered, at least 15 local [[List of television channels in Afghanistan|Afghan television channels]], and 60 radio stations.<ref name="fh">[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=251&year=2008 Afghanistan Press Report 2008], ''Freedom House''. {{webarchive |url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091002234739/http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=251&year=2008 |date=2 October 2009 }}</ref> Foreign radio stations, such as [[Voice of America]], [[BBC World Service]], and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (RFE/RL) broadcast into the country.

The city of Kabul has been home to many musicians who were masters of both traditional and modern [[Music of Afghanistan|Afghan music]]. Traditional music is especially popular during the [[Nowruz]] (New Year) and [[Afghan Independence Day|National Independence Day]] celebrations. [[Ahmad Zahir]], [[Nashenas]], [[Mohammad Hussain Sarahang|Ustad Sarahang]], [[Abdul Rahim Sarban|Sarban]], [[Ubaidullah Jan]], [[Farhad Darya]], and [[Naghma]] are some of the notable Afghan musicians, but there are many others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afghanland.com/entertainment/music/bio.html |title=Artist Biographies |publisher=Afghanland.com |accessdate=17 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809214750/http://www.afghanland.com/entertainment/music/bio.html |archivedate=9 August 2013 }}</ref> Most Afghans are accustomed to watching Indian [[Bollywood]] films and listening to its [[filmi]] hit songs. Many major Bollywood film stars have roots in Afghanistan, including [[Salman Khan]], [[Saif Ali Khan]], [[Shah Rukh Khan]] (SRK), [[Aamir Khan]], [[Feroz Khan (Indian actor)|Feroz Khan]], [[Kader Khan]], [[Naseeruddin Shah]], [[Zarine Khan]] and [[Celina Jaitly]].

Other popular sports in Afghanistan include basketball, volleyball, [[taekwondo]], and [[bodybuilding]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/sports |title=Sports |work=[[Pajhwok Afghan News]] |publisher=pajhwok.com |accessdate=14 September 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209082121/http://www.pajhwok.com/en/sports |archivedate=9 February 2014 }}</ref> [[Buzkashi]] is a traditional sport, mainly among the northern Afghans. It is similar to [[polo]], played by horsemen in two teams, each trying to grab and hold a goat carcass.
