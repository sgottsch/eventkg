'''Agriculture''' is the cultivation of [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s and [[Fungus|fungi]] for [[food]], [[fiber]], [[biofuel]], [[medicinal]] and other products used to sustain and enhance human life.<ref name="Office1999">{{cite book |title=Safety and health in agriculture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtBa6XIW_aQC&pg=PA77 |year=1999 |publisher=International Labour Organization |isbn=978-92-2-111517-5 |pages=77– |accessdate=13 September 2010}}</ref> Agriculture was the key development in the rise of [[sedentism|sedentary]] [[human civilization]], whereby farming of [[domestication|domesticated]] species created food [[economic surplus|surpluses]] that nurtured the development of [[civilization]]. The study of agriculture is known as [[agricultural science]]. The [[history of agriculture]] dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different [[climate]]s, [[culture]]s, and technologies. In the civilized world, [[industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]] farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology.

Modern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[agrochemical]]s such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s, and technological developments have in many cases sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects. [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about [[animal welfare]] and the health effects of the [[antibiotics]], [[growth hormone]]s, and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production. [[Genetically modified organism]]s are an increasing component of agriculture, although they are banned in several countries. Agricultural food production and water management are increasingly becoming global issues that are fostering debate on a number of fronts. Significant degradation of land and water resources, including the depletion of [[aquifer]]s, has been observed in recent decades, and the effects of global warming on agriculture and of agriculture on global warming are still not fully understood.

The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, [[fuel]]s, and [[raw material]]s. Specific foods include [[cereal]]s (grains), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[cooking oil|oils]], [[meat]]s and [[spice]]s. Fibers include [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], [[silk]] and [[flax]]. Raw materials include [[lumber]] and [[bamboo]]. Other useful materials are produced by plants, such as [[resin]]s, [[natural dye|dyes]], [[drug]]s, [[perfume]]s, [[biofuel]]s and ornamental products such as [[Floriculture|cut flowers]] and [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery plants]]. Over one third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the services' sector, although the percentages of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.

== Agriculture and civilization ==

Civilization was the product of the Agricultural [[Neolithic Revolution]]. In the course of history, civilization coincided in space with fertile areas ([[The Fertile Crescent]]) and most intensive state formation took place in circumscribed agricultural lands ([[Carneiro's circumscription theory]]). The [[Great Wall]] of China and the Roman [[limes]] demarcated the same northern frontier of the basic (cereal) agriculture. This cereal belt nourished the belt of great civilizations formed in the [[Axial Age]] and connected by the famous [[Silk Road]].

Ancient Egyptians, whose agriculture depended exclusively on Nile, deified the River, worshiped, and exalted in a great hymn.<ref>''Ancient Egyptian Literature: A Book of Readings'', (ed. Miriam Lichtheim, Berkeley & Los Angeles & London: University of California Press, 1975, vol I, p 205-209).</ref> The Chinese imperial court issued numerous edicts, stating: "Agriculture is the foundation of this Empire."<ref>''Han Agriculture: The Foundation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy, 206 BC – AD 220'', (ed. Cho-yun Hsu, Seattle & London: University of Washington Press, p 169-170).</ref> Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Chinese, and Inca Emperors themselves plowed ceremonial fields in order to show personal example to everyone.<ref>[[Guan Zhong]], ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]: Economic Dialogues in Ancient China'', (trs. Po-fu Tan, & Kuang-wen Wen, Connecticut: New Heaven, 1954, p 174); [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], ''History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Man's Recorded History'', New York: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953, p 96-97; Rafael Karsten, ''A Totalitarian State of the Past: The Civilization of the Inca Empire in Ancient Peru'', Helsingforce: Academic Bookstore, 1949, p 93, 181.</ref> 

Ancient strategists, Chinese [[Guan Zhong]]<ref>''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]: Economic Dialogues in Ancient China'', (trs. Po-fu Tan, & Kuang-wen Wen, Connecticut: New Heaven, 1954, p 94, 129-130, 156-157, 362).</ref> and [[Shang Yang]]<ref>''The Book of the Governor of the Shang Region'',( tr. L. S.

Ramaswamy, London: Asia Publishers, 1962, p 126, 128).</ref> drew doctrines linking agriculture with military power. Agriculture defined the limits on how large and for how long an army could be mobilized. Shang Yang called agriculture and war the ''One''.<ref>One chapter Shang Yang titled "Reflections on the One," ''The Book of the Governor of the Shang Region'', (p 150).</ref> In the vast human pantheon of agricultural deities<ref>Category:agricultural deities; Category:agricultural gods</ref> there are several deities who combined the functions of agriculture and war.<ref>The Mesopotamian [[Lahmu]]; the Hittite goddess of [[Arinna]], and the Roman [[Janus]].  From Lahmu derive two Hebrew words—warfare (lehima) and bread (lehem).</ref>

As the Neolithic Agricultural Revolution produced civilization, the modern Agricultural Revolution, begun in Britain ([[British Agricultural Revolution]]), made possible the Industrial civilization. The first precondition for industry was greater yields by less manpower, resulting in greater percentage of manpower available for non-agricultural sectors.<ref>[[Barrington Moore]], ''Social Origins of Democracy and Dictatorship'', (London: Penguin Books, 1967, p 429; Shepard B. Clough & Richard T. Rapp, ''European Economic History: The Economic Development of Western Civilization'', (London & Sydney: McGraw-Hill, 1968, p 258).</ref> 

== Types of agriculture ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}

Nomadic farming refers to the practice of farming in which herdsmen move from one place to another with there families and livestock,in search of pasture, fodder, and water. This type of farming is practiced in arid and semi-arid regions of Sahara,Central Asia and some parts of India like Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir.

In shifting cultivation, a small area of a forest is cleared by cutting down all the trees and the area is burned. Now that area is used for growing crops after some years when the area become less fertile then it is abundant. Again a patch is selected and this process is performed. This type of farming is practiced mainly area with abundant rainfall, so forest regenerate very quickly. They are practiced in North-East India, South-East Asia and the Amazon Basin.

Subsistence farming is practiced by farmer to satisfy his family needs alone nothing is left over sale in other words it is non-commercial farming they use old method and new technology for high production. It is intensively practiced in Monsoon Asia and South-East Asia.

Commercial farming cultivate the crops for commercial purpose i.e., for selling. The main motive of the farmer is to make profit. This type of farming is mainly practice in western countries like Canada and USA.

Dairy farming is the rearing of the cattle on the large scale on the outskirts of the city to meet the demands of milk and animal products is called dairy farming. It is mainly practiced in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark and in Europe.

In the past century,  agriculture has been characterized by increased productivity, the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, [[water pollution]], and [[farm subsidies]]. In recent years there has been a backlash against the [[externality|external]] [[environmental awareness|environmental effects]] of conventional agriculture, resulting in the [[organic farming|organic]] and [[sustainable agriculture]] movements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/04/history-nitrogen-fertilizer-ammonium-nitrate|author=Philpott, Tom|title=A Brief History of Our Deadly Addiction to Nitrogen Fertilizer|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=7 May 2013|publisher=Mother Jones}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=The World Bank|year=1995|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&theSitePK=469372&piPK=64165421&menuPK=64166093&entityID=000009265_3970311122936|title=Overcoming agricultural pollution of water: the challenge of integrating agricultural and environmental policies in the European Union, Volume 1|accessdate=15 April 2013|author=Scheierling, Susanne M.}}</ref> One of the major forces behind this movement has been the [[European Union]], which first certified [[organic food]] in 1991 and began reform of its [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=European Commission|year=2003|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/capreform/index_en.htm|title=CAP Reform|accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref> also known as [[Decoupling and re-coupling|decoupling]]. The growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as [[integrated pest management]] and selective breeding. Recent mainstream technological developments include [[genetically modified food]].

Disease and land degradation are two of the major concerns in agriculture today. For example, an epidemic of [[stem rust]] on wheat caused by the [[Ug99]] lineage is currently spreading across Africa and into Asia and is causing major concerns due to crop losses of 70% or more under some conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/rust/stem/rust-report/stem-ug99racettksk/en/|title=Wheat Stem Rust – UG99 (Race TTKSK)|publisher=FAO|accessdate=6 January 2014}}</ref> Approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded.<ref>Sample, Ian (31 August 2007).

Agrarian structure is a long-term structure in the [[Fernand Braudel|Braudelian]] understanding of the concept. On a larger scale the agrarian structure is more dependent on the regional, social, cultural and historical factors than on the state’s undertaken activities. Like in Poland, where despite running an intense agrarian policy for many years, the agrarian structure in 2002 has much in common with that found in 1921 soon after the [[History of Poland (1795–1918)|partitions period]].<ref>[http://www.agrojournal.org/20/05-03.pdf M.

In 2009, the [[Agriculture in China|agricultural output of China]] was the largest in the world, followed by the European Union, India and the United States, according to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (''[[Agriculture#List of countries by agricultural output|see below]]''). Economists measure the [[total factor productivity]] of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the United States is roughly 1.7 times more productive than it was in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=USDA Economic Research Service|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data/agproductivity/ |title=Agricultural Productivity in the United States|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>

== Workforce ==

{{As of|2011}}, the [[International Labour Organization]] states that approximately one billion people, or over 1/3 of the available work force, are employed in the global agricultural sector. Agriculture constitutes approximately 70% of the global employment of children, and in many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry.<ref name=ILO /> The [[service sector]] only overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 2007. Between 1997 and 2007, the percentage of people employed in agriculture fell by over four percentage points, a trend that is expected to continue.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/story/191279|title=Services sector overtakes farming as world's biggest employer: ILO|agency=Associated Press|date=26 January 2007|accessdate=24 April 2013|publisher=''The Financial Express''}}</ref> The number of people employed in agriculture varies widely on a per-country basis, ranging from less than 2% in countries like the US and Canada to over 80% in many African nations.<ref name=LaborForce>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2048.html|title=Labor Force – By Occupation|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|work=The World Factbook|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref> In developed countries, these figures are significantly lower than in previous centuries. During the 16th century in Europe, for example, between 55 and 75 percent of the population was engaged in agriculture, depending on the country. By the 19th century in Europe, this had dropped to between 35 and 65 percent.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://economics.ouls.ox.ac.uk/13621/1/uuid9ef3c3c6-512f-44b6-b74e-53266cc42ae2-ATTACHMENT01.pdf|format=PDF|title=Economic structure and agricultural productivity in Europe, 1300–1800|journal=European Review of Economic History|volume=3|pages=1–25|author=Allen, Robert C.}}</ref> In the same countries today, the figure is less than 10%.<ref name=LaborForce />

Agriculture, specifically [[farm]]ing, remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, [[noise-induced hearing loss]], skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. On [[industrial agriculture|industrialized farms]], injuries frequently involve the use of [[agricultural machinery]], and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers.<ref name="aginjury">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aginjury/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety & Health Topic: Agricultural Injuries|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=16 April 2013}}</ref> Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects.<ref name=NIOSH_pest>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-108/ |title=NIOSH Pesticide Poisoning Monitoring Program Protects Farmworkers|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref> As an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for injuries, illness, and death.<ref name="NIOSH Agri">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/agriculture/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety & Health Topic: Agriculture|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=16 April 2013}}</ref> Common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.<ref name="NIOSH Agri" />

[[File:Rice terraces.png|thumb|The [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] in [[Ifugao]], Philippines]]

Cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.<ref name="FAO FS">{{cite web|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|url=http://www.fao.org/farmingsystems/description_en.htm|title=Analysis of farming systems|accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref><ref name="PCP APS">Acquaah, G. 2002. Agricultural Production Systems. pp. 283 – 317 in "Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology". Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.</ref>

[[Shifting cultivation]] (or [[slash and burn]]) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then [[perennial plant|perennial]] crops for a period of several years.<ref name="CS">Chrispeels, M.J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. "Farming Systems: Development, Productivity, and Sustainability". pp. 25 – 57 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.</ref> Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10 – 20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or [[manure]]) and some manual [[pest control]]. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.

Further industrialization led to the use of [[monoculture]]s, when one [[cultivar]] is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low [[biodiversity]], nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of [[pesticide]]s and fertilizers.<ref name="PCP APS" /> [[Multiple cropping]], in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and [[intercropping]], when several crops are grown at the same time, are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as [[polyculture]]s.<ref name="CS" />

In [[subtropics|subtropical]] and [[arid]] environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring [[irrigation]]. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry. In [[Temperateness|temperate]] environments, where ecosystems were predominantly [[grassland]] or [[prairie]], highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system.<ref name="CS" />

Animals, including horses, [[mule]]s, [[ox]]en, [[water buffalo]], [[camel]]s, [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, [[donkey]]s, and dogs, are often used to help cultivate fields, [[harvest]] crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers. Animal husbandry not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, [[egg (food)|eggs]], or [[wool]]) on a continual basis, but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship.

Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as grassland-based, mixed, and landless.<ref name="FAO lps">{{cite web|author=Sere, C.; Steinfeld, H.; Groeneweld, J.|year=1995|url=http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/LEAD/X6101E/x6101e00.htm#Contents|title=Description of Systems in World Livestock Systems – Current status issues and trends|publisher=U.N.

Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050.<ref name=LP>{{cite journal|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2853.full|title=Livestock production: recent trends, future prospects|author=Thornton, Philip K.|doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0134|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|date=27 September 2010|volume=365|issue=1554|pages=2853}}</ref> [[Aquaculture]] or fish farming, the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9% a year between 1975 and 2007.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1663604,00.html|title=Fish Farming's Growing Dangers|journal=Time|author=Stier, Ken|date=19 September 2007}}</ref>

During the second half of the 20th century, producers using [[selective breeding]] focused on creating livestock [[breed]]s and [[crossbreed]]s that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve [[genetic diversity]]. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A global view of livestock biodiversity and conservation – GLOBALDIV|author=P.

Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as [[shrubland]], [[rangeland]], and [[managed intensive rotational grazing|pastures]] for feeding [[ruminant]] animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30 – 40 million pastoralists.<ref name="CS" /> Mixed production systems use grassland, [[fodder]] crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.<ref name="FAO lps" />

Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]](OECD) member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.<ref name="FAO lps" /> Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in [[confined animal feeding operations]], sometimes called [[factory farming]]. Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa.<ref name=LP /> Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of [[growth hormone]]s, are controversial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.pdf |title=Growth Promoting Hormones Pose Health Risk to Consumers, Confirms EU Scientific Committee|date=23 April 2002|accessdate=6 April 2013|publisher=European Union}}</ref>

== Production practices ==

[[File:Mt Uluguru and Sisal plantations.jpg|thumb|Road leading across the farm allows machinery access to the farm for production practices]]

Farming is the practice of agriculture by specialized labor in an area primarily devoted to agricultural processes, in service of a dislocated population usually in a [[city]].

Tillage is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to [[no-till farming|no-till]]. It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO<sub>2</sub>, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.<ref name="Soil">Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils. Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.</ref><ref name="PCP Tillage">Acquaah, G. 2002. "Land Preparation and Farm Energy" pp.318 – 338 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.</ref>

Pest control includes the management of weeds, [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, and diseases. Chemical (pesticides), biological ([[biocontrol]]), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include [[crop rotation]], [[culling]], [[cover crop]]s, intercropping, [[compost]]ing, avoidance, and [[Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|resistance]]. Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.<ref name="PCP Pest">Acquaah, G. 2002. "Pesticide Use in U.S. Crop Production" pp.240 – 282 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.</ref>

[[Nutrient management]] includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of utilization of [[manure]] produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, [[manure]], [[green manure]], compost and mined [[minerals]].<ref name="PCP Soil">Acquaah, G. 2002. "Soil and Land" pp.165 – 210 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''.

[[Water management]] is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world.<ref name="CS" /> Some farmers use [[irrigation]] to supplement rainfall. In other areas such as the [[Great Plains]] in the U.S. and Canada, farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year.<ref name="PCP Water">Acquaah, G. 2002.

== Crop alteration and biotechnology ==
{{Main|Plant breeding}}

[[File:Ueberladewagen (jha).jpg|thumb|[[Tractor]] and [[chaser bin]]]]

Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist [[Gregor Mendel]]. His work on [[dominant allele|dominant]] and [[recessive allele]]s, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, [[self-pollination]] and [[cross-pollination]], and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |title=History of Plant Breeding|date=29 January 2004|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref>

Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease resistance and [[drought tolerance]], eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in [[New Zealand]]. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Stadler |first= L.

The [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] to sharply increase yield by creating "high-yielding varieties". For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, growth control to avoid lodging).<ref>{{cite journal |last= Ruttan |first= Vernon W. |title= Biotechnology and Agriculture: A Skeptical Perspective |journal= AgBioForum |volume= 2 |issue= 1 |pages= 54–60 |date=December 1999 |url= http://www.agbioforum.org/v2n1/v2n1a10-ruttan.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last= Cassman |first= K.

[[Genetically modified organism]]s (GMO) are [[organism]]s whose [[Genetics|genetic]] material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as [[recombinant DNA technology]]. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/index.html|title=20 Questions on Genetically Modified Foods|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=16 April 2013}}</ref> For some, GMO crops cause [[food safety]] and [[food labeling regulations|food labeling]] concerns.

Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including [[glyphosate]]s. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop.

Agriculture, as implemented through the method of farming, imposes external costs upon society through pesticides, nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, loss of natural environment and assorted other problems.

An alternative argument is that the way to "save the environment" and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'.<ref name="DAvery">{{cite book|author=Avery, D.T.|year=2000|title=Saving the Planet with Pesticides and Plastic: The Environmental Triumph of High-Yield Farming|publisher=Hudson Institute|location=Indianapolis, IN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Center for Global Food Issues|url=http://www.cgfi.org/ |title=Home|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable,<ref name="WH">Lappe, F.M., J.

"The implementation of push-pull in eastern Africa has significantly increased maize yields and the combined cultivation of N-fixing forage crops has enriched the soil and has also provided farmers with feed for livestock. With increased livestock operations, the farmers are able to produce meat, milk and other dairy products and they use the manure as organic fertiliser that returns nutrients to the fields."<ref name="unep.org" />

=== Climate change ===
{{See also|Climate change and agriculture}}

Climate change has the potential to affect agriculture through changes in temperature, rainfall (timing and quantity), [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]], [[solar radiation]] and the interaction of these elements.<ref name="CS" /> Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Harvey, Fiona|date=18 November 2011|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/18/extreme-weather-climate-change-ipcc|title=Extreme weather will strike as climate change takes hold, IPCC warns|journal=The Guardian}}</ref> Agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply for example, will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population. Fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twenty-first century. Based on the experience of countries in the Nile river basin (Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan) and other developing countries, depletion of water resources during seasons crucial for agriculture can lead to a decline in yield by up to 50%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/11374Nile%20concise.pdf|title=Report: Blue Peace for the Nile|publisher=Strategic Foresight Group|accessdate=20 August 2013|format=PDF}}</ref> Transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bs-agro.com/index.php/20152-pessimism-about-future-grows-in-agribusiness|title=World: Pessimism about future grows in agribusiness}}</ref> For example, policies, practices and tools promoting climate-smart agriculture will be important, as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability.

Agriculture in its many forms can both mitigate or worsen [[global warming]]. Some of the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] comes from the [[decomposition]] of [[organic matter]] in the soil, and much of the methane emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as rice [[paddy field]]s,<ref name="Soils OM">Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. "Soil Organic Matter" pp. 353 – 385 in ''Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils''. Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.</ref> as well as the normal digestive activities of farm animals. Further, wet or [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] soils also lose nitrogen through [[denitrification]], releasing the greenhouse gases [[nitric oxide]] and nitrous oxide.<ref name="Soils N">Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. "Nitrogen and Sulfur Economy of Soils" pp. 386 – 421 in ''Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils''. Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.</ref> Changes in management can reduce the release of these greenhouse gases, and soil can further be used to [[carbon capture and storage|sequester]] some of the CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.<ref name="Soils OM" /> Informed by the UNEP, "[a]griculture also produces about 58 per cent of global nitrous oxide emissions and about 47 per cent of global methane emissions. Cattle and rice farms release methane, fertilized fields release nitrous oxide, and the cutting down of rainforests to grow crops or raise livestock releases carbon dioxide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=A Five-Step Plan to Feed The World|last=Foley|first=Jonathan|date=May 2014|work=National Geographic|access-date=}}</ref>  Both of these gases have a far greater global warming potential per tonne than CO2 (298 times and 25 times respectively)."<ref name="unep.org" />

There are several factors within the field of agriculture that contribute to the large amount of CO2 emissions. The diversity of the sources ranges from the production of farming tools to the transport of harvested produce. Approximately 8% of the national carbon footprint is due to agricultural sources. Of that, 75% is of the carbon emissions released from the production of crop assisting chemicals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hillier|first=Jonathon|author2=C. Hawes|author3=G. Squire|author4=A. Hilton|title=The carbon footprints of food crop production|journal=International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability|year=2009|volume=7|issue=2|pages=107–118|doi=10.3763/ijas.2009.0419}}</ref> Factories producing insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers are a major culprit of the greenhouse gas. Productivity on the farm itself and the use of machinery is another source of the carbon emission. Almost all the industrial machines used in modern farming are powered by fossil fuels. These instruments are burning fossil fuels from the beginning of the process to the end. Tractors are the root of this source. The tractor is going to burn fuel and release CO2 just to run. The amount of emissions from the machinery increase with the attachment of different units and need for more power. During the soil preparation stage tillers and plows will be used to disrupt the soil. During growth watering pumps and sprayers are used to keep the crops hydrated. And when the crops are ready for picking a forage or combine harvester is used. These types of machinery all require additional energy which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the basic tractors.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lal|first=Rattan|title=Carbon emission from farm operations|journal=Environmental International|year=2004|volume=30|issue=7|pages=981–990|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2004.03.005}}</ref> The final major contribution to CO2 emissions in agriculture is in the final transport of produce. Local farming suffered a decline over the past century due to large amounts of farm subsidies. The majority of crops are shipped hundreds of miles to various processing plants before ending up in the grocery store. These shipments are made using fossil fuel burning modes of transportation. Inevitably these transport adds to carbon dioxide emissions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=West|first=T.O.|author2=G. Marland|title=Net carbon flux from agricultural ecosystems: methodology for full carbon cycle analyses|journal=Environmental Pollution|year=2002|volume=116|issue=3|pages=439–444|doi=10.1016/s0269-7491(01)00221-4}}</ref>

=== Sustainability ===

Some major organizations are hailing farming within [[agroecosystem]]s as the way forward for mainstream agriculture. Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. According to a report by the [[International Water Management Institute]] and [[UNEP]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Boelee, E. (Ed)|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/topics/ecosystems/|title=Ecosystems for water and food security|year=2011|publisher=IWMI/UNEP|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and [[ecosystem]] resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. The report suggested assigning value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests. Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for
more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.<ref>{{cite web|author=Molden, D.|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/news_room/pdf/The-scientist_com-Opinion_The%20Water_Deficit.pdf |title=Opinion: The Water Deficit|format=PDF|publisher=''The Scientist''|accessdate=23 August 2011}}</ref>

Technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://croplife.intraspin.com/pesticides/paper.asp?id=461|author=Safefood Consulting, Inc.|title=Benefits of Crop Protection Technologies on Canadian Food Production, Nutrition, Economy and the Environment|year=2005|publisher=CropLife International|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> New technologies have given rise to innovations like [[conservation tillage]], a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion, water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Trewavas, Anthony|title=A critical assessment of organic farming-and-food assertions with particular respect to the UK and the potential environmental benefits of no-till agriculture|journal=Crop Protection |year=2004|pages=757–781|doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2004.01.009|volume=23|issue=9}}</ref>

According to a report by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),<ref name=ifpri /> agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, IFPRI found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.

However, {{as of|2009|lc=y}}, there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices.

Modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: 1. direct consumption on the farm and 2. indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery; and use of gasoline, liquid [[propane]], and electricity to power dryers, pumps, lights, heaters, and coolers. American farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion BTU) in 2002, or just over 1% of the nation's total energy.<ref name="ncseonline.org">{{cite web|author=Schnepf, Randy|date=19 November 2004|title=Energy use in Agriculture: Background and Issues|work=CRS Report for Congress|url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/RL32677.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>

Indirect consumption is mainly oil and [[natural gas]] used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides, which accounted for 0.6 exajoules (0.6 quadrillion BTU) in 2002.<ref name="ncseonline.org" /> The natural gas and coal consumed by the production of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] can account for over half of the agricultural energy usage. China utilizes mostly coal in the production of nitrogen fertilizer, while most of Europe uses large amounts of natural gas and small amounts of coal. According to a 2010 report published by [[The Royal Society]], agriculture is increasingly dependent on the direct and indirect input of fossil fuels. Overall, the fuels used in agriculture vary based on several factors, including crop, production system and location.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2991.full|title=Energy and the food system|author=Jeremy Woods, Adrian Williams, John K.

Together, direct and indirect consumption by US farms accounts for about 2% of the nation's energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979, and has gradually declined over the past 30 years.<ref name="ncseonline.org" /> [[Food systems]] encompass not just agricultural production, but also off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the US.<ref name="css.snre.umich.edu" /><ref name="ers.usda.gov" />

In the event of a petroleum shortage (see [[peak oil]] for global concerns), organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Some studies using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields as high as those available from conventional farming.<ref name=UMinnSustainable>{{cite web|url=http://www.misa.umn.edu/Search_and_Ask/FAQ/FeedtheWorld/index.htm|title=Can Sustainable Agriculture Really Feed the World?|date=August 2010|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref> In the aftermath of the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], with shortages of conventional petroleum-based inputs, Cuba made use of mostly organic practices, including [[biopesticides]], plant-based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices, to feed its populace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chge.med.harvard.edu/resource/cuban-organic-farming-experiment|title=Cuban Organic Farming Experiment|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref> However, organic farming may be more [[labour (economics)|labor]]-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas.<ref>{{cite web|author=Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L.|year=2007|url=http://ccwiki.pbworks.com/f/CAStudy-Barriers-Organic-CIRS-2007.pdf|title= Conventional, Mixed, and "Deregistered" Organic Farmers: Entry Barriers and Reasons for Exiting Organic Production in California|publisher=California Institute for Rural Studies|accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref> The [[soil conditioner|reconditioning of soil]] to restore nutrients lost during the use of monoculture agriculture techniques also takes time.<ref name=UMinnSustainable />

It has been suggested that rural communities might obtain fuel from the [[biochar]] and [[synfuel]] process, which uses agricultural ''waste'' to provide charcoal fertilizer, some fuel ''and'' food, instead of the normal [[food vs. fuel]] debate. As the synfuel would be used on-site, the process would be more efficient and might just provide enough fuel for a new organic-agriculture fusion.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU05/11082/EGU05-J-11082-2.pdf|author=P.

{{Main|Agricultural policy}}

[[File:United States farm subsidies (source Congressional Budget Office).svg|thumb|290px|From a [[Congressional Budget Office]] report]]

[[Agricultural policy]] is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters), [[economic stability]] (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and [[environmental sustainability]] (especially [[water resource management|water policy]]), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries).<ref>{{cite journal|page=13|title=Agricultural and food policy choices in Australia|journal=Sustainable agriculture and food policy in the 21st century: challenges and solutions|publisher=Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics – Bureau of Rural Sciences|date=October 2010|accessdate=22 April 2013|author=Lindsay Hogan and Paul Morris|url=http://adl.brs.gov.au/data/warehouse/pe_abarebrs99001749/CP10.15_Agric_food_policy_CONFERENCE_PAPER.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Agricultural policy can also touch on [[food quality]], ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and [[Conservation biology|conservation]]. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/pol/agr/|title=Agriculture: Not Just Farming&nbsp;... |publisher=European Union|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>

There are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. [[Agribusiness]] interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of [[lobbying]] and [[campaign contribution]]s. Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and [[labor union]]s, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-Corporatization%20of%20Fm%20Pol%20%289-10%29.htm|title=Corporatization of Agricultural Policy|author=Ikerd, John|journal=Small Farm Today Magazine|year=2010}}</ref> The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Dr. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/sep/22/food-firms-lobbying-samuel-jutzi |title=Corporate Lobbying Is Blocking Food Reforms, Senior UN Official Warns: Farming Summit Told of Delaying Tactics by Large Agribusiness and Food Producers on Decisions that Would Improve Human Health and the Environment |location=London |first=Juliette |last=Jowit |date= 22 September 2010 |newspaper= The Guardian}}</ref>
